Psychic Warfare Defense Systems
===============
Keeping your mind safe

![](./images/image.png)

[Last post](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/psychic-war) I talked about the daily battle we all face - adversaries hunting for control of your mind.

Today's about the defense systems I've built to keep control of my mind.

Philosophy
----------
CRUCIAL INSIGHT 1: **You are being hunted by robots that never tire. Your defenses must also be systematized.**

Meaning, deploy tech. Build systems.

CRUCIAL INSIGHT 2: **Money is cheaper than time and psychic energy.**
People have built good products that help remove distractions. Some of these products are paid.

Yet so many people refuse to pay money for products... which means they're paying with their time and psychic energy.

I consider a couple dollars a month well worth the price of spending my time on what's important to me.

CRUCIAL INSIGHT 3: **Take the best, leave the rest.**

There are certain sites where

But if you've totally blocked Instagram, how do you preview that restaurant? If you've blocked Youtube, how do you watch that valuable video your friend sent you?

This is intentional, of course.

These apps draw you in with genuinely valuable stuff, then keep you with addicting stuff.

So we must eliminate that bad while keeping the good.

CRUCIAL INSIGHT 4: **The internet is the problem**
Take away the internet and your phone/computer are WAY more boring.

CRUCIAL INSIGHT 4: **Fall in the right direction.**

If you're relying on discipline, you need to be perfect.

You can do it right 99 out of 100 days, but one imperfect day can lead to a doomscrolling late night that tires you for the next day which makes you more likely to doomscroll the next day. Doing the right is hard, and doing the wrong thing is easy.

Conversely, if you set up a bunch of systems you have to disable to doomscroll, it becomes hard to do the wrong thing and easy to do the right one.

Site Blockers
-------------
I group sites into two categories.

### Hard blocks
The first are sites I judge I don't ever need to be on:

- Porn sites
- HackerNews (there's of course great news here, but I get it from other sources)
- xkcd (I can still see comics on explainxkcd.com, without the addicting Prev/Random/Next buttons)
- Twitch.tv

I block these with [this blanket blocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/block-site-site-blocker-f/dpfofggmkhdbfcciajfdphofclabnogo).

### Soft blocks
The second are sites that are useful during the day, but have a high risk of addiction especially at night:

- Youtube
- Reddit
- Instagram
- X
- Facebook
- Wikipedia (yep)
- Amazon (for prime video)

For these I use [this blocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-site-blocker/aoabjfoanlljmgnohepbkimcekolejjn) with time rules so that the above sites are blocked between 20:30 and 07:15.

I then configure it with an exception so that my Instagram profile page and my X.com profile page are always allowed, thereby allowing me to produce content but not consume it.

### Passwords
Both site blockers are secured with a password.

That password is randomly generated, 30 characters long, and written down on a piece of paper in my apartment (not digital, so I can't copy-paste).

If I want to make changes, this forces me to be at home and type a long-ass password by hand.

App Blockers
------------
I've determined that I want 8 hours of sleep.

Meaning, I need to be in bed for 9 hours.

Working backwards gives me a bedtime of 22:00.

My [sleep guide](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/the-sleep-guide) taught me I need about 1.5h of downtime before bed to fall asleep easily.

So I've configured my laptop and phone to block apps with a high risk of addiction after 20:30.

On my Macbook, I use [Mac's Downtime feature](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/manage-downtime-in-screen-time-mchl69510069/mac) to block everything except specific allowed apps which aren't going to wind me up.

Some example whitelisted apps:
- Terminal
- Spotify
- Claude
- 1Password
- Todoist
- Notion

Everything else gets blocked, including:
- Chrome
- Gmail
- Whatsapp
- iMessages

On my Pixel, I do the equivalent using [AppBlock](https://appblock.app/). These apps get blocked after 20:30:
- Instagram
- Chrome
- Whatsapp
- Discord
- Gmail

I've also configured it so that Instagram only unblocks at 07:30 and Discord at 09:00, so there's no risk of me waking up and immediately going to them.

Instagram
---------
On Instagram itself, the Feed and the Search page were the two biggest Instagram black holes for me.

On my Macbook, I've installed [Antigram](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/antigram-explore-reels-bl/igbheapdmolhhmmklmkfjjjncmhihfjh) to block both.

On my phone I've installed [Distraction Free Instagram](https://www.distractionfreeapps.com/), and configured it to remove the Search grid and Feed as well.

CAVEAT: Distraction Free Instagram is _amazing_, but it seems to be a side project by a dev out of Australia. You might need a VPN to get to the site, Instagram obviously doesn't like this, and the guy releases updates very rarely.

Reddit
------
In addition to being blocked after 20:30, I've installed [Old Reddit redirect](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/old-reddit-redirect/dneaehbmnbhcippjikoajpoabadpodje) to make Reddit less dopaminergic.

CAVEAT: Photos which users uploaded to Reddit's own photo-hosting service won't work with this. I consider it an acceptable tradeoff.

Youtube
-------
Youtube is the biggest risk for me, so I've invested heavily in controlling it (beyond blocking it after 20:30).



Tiktok
------
I don't use or have Tiktok, so this is easy.

Streaming Services
------------------
I don't subscribe to Netflix or any other streaming service. This removes the option to watch, which forces me to figure out other ways to spend my time.

Taking away the option is a marvelous way to keep control of your brain.
