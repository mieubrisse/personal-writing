title: "On Sexuality"

_Written 2022-10-01_

This blog has several posts that discuss my relationship with women, and the inherently sexual nature of that relationship. I wrote them with intentionality, 

I wrote those posts with a "wear my heart on my sleeve" mentality, because I believe that owning your authentic beliefs, genuinely,  I believe that authenticity requires putting your truth out into the world and seeing who resonates with it. The tremendous benefit is that you live your genuine self, surround yourself with people who love you for who you are, and develop an adaptable "no matter what comes, I will survive it" mentality.

Yet, the risks of revealing one's vulnerabilities are real: authenticity is a filter, and it's inevitable that people won't resonate with what I express. When the topic is  as delicate as sensuality - inextricable from self-worth, and often linked to some form of shame or judgment - then

Still other people - hostile parties - can even use the revealed insecurities and quirks as ammunition. When I started this blog, I believed that the majority of people listen to each other, try to understand context, and give each other the benefit of the doubt. I still believe this, but I've since endured a situation where my words were cherry-picked - and my context intentionally excluded - because portraying me as self-serving and opportunistic would be to another's benefit. This was frustrating and exhausting, and while the portrayal ultimately failed I began to ask myself if it weren't better to be guarded in public and authentic only in private.

These thoughts have been particularly top-of-mind as Kurtosis grows. The media is notorious for reducing a nuanced discussion down to the cherry-picked quote that elicits the most outrage, and our increasing presence in the public eye will make it ever more profitable to do so. I have a duty to protect and grow Kurtosis; could that duty be conflicting with my personal desire for fearless authenticity?

This question feels particularly pertinent given the nature of what I think and write about. Sensuality is a delicate topic, inextricable from self-worth, and often linked to some form of shame or judgment. Kurtosis is on a mission and it's extremely important to me that we stay coherent internally. 






We're on a mission at Kurtosis, and it's very important to me not to compromise the cohesion of our culture.


Kurtosis is an American business venture, and discussions of sex are taboo in American professional culture. I'm mostly fine with this: sensuality is a delicate topic, inextricable from self-worth, and often linked to some form of shame or judgment. It's very important to me that Kurtosians feel 









While this is a personal blog, I have 



We're trying to accomplish a mission at Kurtosis, and doing so requires Kurtosians who feel safe and united. A topic as hot-button as sexuality is risky, 



Mainstream media is notorious for taking a complex, nuanced view and distilling it down to a shocking-sounding sound bite that brings clicks.






TODO media is infamous for this


where the opposing side cherry-picked Whatsapp messages - intentionally excluding context - to construct the most damning-sounding quote possible.

Authenticity is a filter, and it _will_ filter

Still others - hostile parties - will use the insecurities and quirks I reveal as ammunition.

Authenticity is also scary. By revealing my insecurities and areas where I don't match the societal norm, I give a hostile party ammunition. When I started this blog, I believed that 

Further, it's scary: It's easy to take a negative reaction and think, "It would be better not to project that truth, or only project it to those I'm close to."


Therein lies the conflict: 

I actually haven't had negative reactions
TODO I know what it's like to have an adversary intentionally twist your words



The power of authenticity, I believe, lies in how it says, "Even though you may reject me, this is who I am and I am okay as I am."



Since Kurtosis has grown, I've been thinking long and hard about those posts
