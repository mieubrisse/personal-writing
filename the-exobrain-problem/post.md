_This post is part of a series on leverage. Here are parts [one][leveraged-judgment], [two](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/shattered-glass-and-negative-leverage), and [three][first-do-nothing]._

I've [said it before][leveraged-judgment]: the modern world is Fucking Leveraged. Small decisions = huge consequences. 

Working smart doesn't just beat working hard. Decisionmaking defines outcomes.

Shitty decisions, shitty outcomes. Good decisions, good outcomes.

Good decisions _factor in_ luck. Pro poker players know this.

Too bad we suck at decisionmaking.

Our default thinking mode is lazy, emotional, and wrong ([Kahneman's System 1 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=System%201%3A%20Fast%2C%20automatic%2C%20frequent%2C%20emotional%2C%20stereotypic%2C%20unconscious.)).

[We overestimate urgency. We get reactive. We panic, and create more work for ourselves.][first-do-nothing]

Or we fixate on the obvious solution, missing non-obvious shortcuts.

We _can_ think clearly ([Kahneman's System 2 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=System%202%3A%20Slow%2C%20effortful%2C%20infrequent%2C%20logical%2C%20calculating%2C%20conscious))... but it's slow and hard.

But it's **really valuable**. 

In [Clear Thinking](https://www.amazon.com.br/Clear-Thinking-Turning-Ordinary-Extraordinary/dp/B0BVNQQ41V), Shane Parrish says:

> Good judgment is expensive... but poor judgment costs a fortune.

It's not that we don't know how to exercise good judgment.

It's that we get hijacked by the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking:

- **The ego default:** "I need to prove I'm right"
- **The emotion default:** "I'm angry/afraid so I react"
- **The social default:** "Everyone else is doing it"
- **The inertia default:** "It's what I've always done"

To guard against poor judgment, Clear Thinking advocates protective systems.

The idea: you make rules ([Ulysses pacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact)) while you're calm and clear, with your values and goals in mind. These save you when the Four Horsemen hit.

These are things like...

- "I don't make decisions on the day I get big news" (guards against emotional reactivity)
- "I don't respond when I'm feeling worked up" (guards against emotional reactivity)
- "I diversify my portfolio regardless of what the market is doing" (guards against greed and desire to follow the herd)
- "I don't make commitments on the phone" (guards against social pressure)
- "I don't eat after 8pm" (guards against inertia and stress eating)
- "I take a few seconds to breathe before I open Instagram" (guards against inertia, reflexively opening Instagram)

Clear Thinking again:

> [Good judgment] is about designing systems at your best, that work for you at your worst.

Technology tries to help.

For example, [here's an app that forces you to wait a second every time you open Instagram](https://one-sec.app/).

And [here's another that blocks apps during certain hours](https://appblock.app/).

But these are limited.



What if your worst decisionmaking days looked the same as your best?





, so that you're protected when the following Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking hit:

- 

", . decisions made while thinking clearly to guard us against his four defaults that result in poor judgment:

- 

These are things like:

- Rules ("I will make no commitments on a phone call, before I think about it") 
- Pre-commitments,  (also known as [Schelling fences](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbm6QnJv9dgWsPHQP/schelling-fences-on-slippery-slopes))
