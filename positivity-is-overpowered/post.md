Positivity Is Overpowered
=========================
TODO SUBTITLE TEXT

![](./images/image.png)

Two weeks ago I dropped my wallet somewhere on the streets of São Paulo.

Every Brazilian I knew was telling me how I was screwed because "o brasileiro é safado" - basically, the average Brazilian person is shady.

Yet strangely, my credit card never got charged.

So I held on to hope that I might still find it.

And lo, I happened to check the metro's Lost & Found website today and sure enough... my wallet had been turned in.

I found my wallet exactly as I'd lost it: identity cards, credit card, and $30 worth of BRL still inside.

Meaning, somebody found the wallet on the street, chose integrity over theft, and took the time to return it to the metro Lost & Found.

Far from being an exceptional experience, this has been the norm in life.

I forget things in Ubers and they come back to me.

I've (unwisely) left my laptop unguarded as I go to the bathroom, and it's still there when I come back.

I've left things in gym locker rooms unlocked, and they're still there when I return.

And I'm no novice traveler.

I've been living outside the US for more than a decade.

I've travelled to 42 countries.

I've lived in 7.

Wherever I go, my experience has been that the average human - be they in Singapore or Saudi Arabia or Brazil - is a good person.

A friend of mine laughingly dismissed my optimism as the "good heart" of a Midwestern boy.

By contrast, he felt his experiences as a New Yorker let him see reality as it _really_ was: hard, gritty, cynical.

He seemed to take pride in

I grew up hearing, over and over:

"There are a lot of weird people in the world"

See, my parents believe that the world is a scary place.

To them, you must always be on guard: always alert for being taken advantage of.

And I believed them.

As I began to travel in my twenties, I kept my suspicions high - keeping people at a polite distance, worried about being defrauded, kidnapped, or robbed.

But as the travel months turned into years, my experiences didn't square with what my parents had drilled into my head.








Every Brazilian I knew said, "Cancel your card _now_!"

But I didn't. 

I figured I'd give a chance to find it, and if there was an unrecognized charge I could always dispute it.


This has been a choice



I've now spent a decade travelling.

I've visited 42 countries.

I've lived in 7.

And my experience tells me that the average human - be they in Singapore or Saudi Arabia or Brazil - is a good person.

They're trying to do right.



I've never been robbed or kidnapped. I've never had anything stolen. And many times, when I lose something, it comes back to me.

I may not understand their culture, and they may hold beliefs I disagree with, but at the bottom of it all they're trying to do right for themselves and the people around them.

Positivity is good for you

MLKJr, Obama, Mandela, Gandhi, Lincoln, Jesus - all these guys called people to be the best versions of themselves. They _believed_ in others.

Positivity is literally positive: it _adds_

Negativity is literally negative: it _removes_
