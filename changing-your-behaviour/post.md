title: "Changing Your Behaviour"
subtitle: "A practical guide to changing your own behaviour"
---

I've learned a few things about behavioural change in my life. This article will teach you what I've learned.

The ideas are a bit controversial, so here some of my results:

- I was shy and introverted in my youth. People are now surprised when they learn I am still an introvert: "I never would have guessed!"
- I was addicted to World of Warcraft for 5 years, tallying more than 100 days of playtime and nearly getting expelled from university for poor grades. I kicked that habit, and haven't played World of Warcraft since 2011.
- I was addicted to Youtube in my twenties, frequently staying up until 02:00, 03:00, or even 05:00 watching videos I didn't care about when I had to work the next day. I kicked that habit, and can't remember the last time I had a binge.
- I was inconsistent with weightlifting for more than 15 years, never making real progress. I am now 2.5 years consistent, and recently achieved my lifelong goal of a 100kg (220lb) bench press.
- I taught myself to climb, and after 2 years of consistency am now a V5 climber.
- I taught myself guitar, and have been playing almost every day for a year. I most recently completed [an acoustic cover of "Californication" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCp66YPuAMJ/).
- I steadily reduced my alcohol consumption for years, and am now 4 months sober.

All of the above was achieved without chemical assistance. I've never taken psychiatric medication. I've never taken performance-enhancing drugs (unless you count whey protein, creatine, and caffeine). I have taken psychedelics, though my number of uses is around 10 right now and I don't feel I got any lasting behavioural change from them.

STRUCTURE
- Consistency over intensity
    - If you do ANYTHING for 2 years every day, you're going to get good at it
        - 
    - Take the pressure OFF!
    - Need patience, which is only positive from a positive view of the future
    - Don't freak out 
        - You're NOT crazy; you're very sensible
        - DON'T beat yourself up

- DON'T use chemicals or shorcuts
    - Testosterone, antidepressants, antianxiolytics, ozempic
    - The long way is important; you suffer for it which means you actually change and value the change
        - Psychology: humans don't value things they get for free

TACTICS
- Setting easy goals that incrementally increase
    - Don't freak out if you drop down; sawtooth pattern is up
        - Humans feel losses at roughly 2x the gains
- Give yourself rewards
    - I don't believe in punishments; want to train yourself to associate goals with good things
- Setting a low minimum that you hit every single day
    - Take the pressure OFF!!
- 20 Minute Method
    - If you miss...
        - No making it up!

Consistency Over Intensity
--------------------------
First controversial opinion: effective change _must_ be a slow process.

We're addicted to quick results these days, and modern marketing helpfully tells us we can have them. 

Forget fast results. Effective change _must_ be a slow process, because if it's too fast then the results will enslave you. Consider the following:

- The absurd number of lottery winners who go bankrupt because they don't have the necessary skills to keep and grow such a fortune
- 
- The statistics 
- The effects



It's not that you just haven't found the right shortcut, blog post, or Instagram reel. **A fast way does not exist.**

This flies in the face of the fast results that we want, and the fast results that all modern marketing promises. Forget fast results. They're a tempting lie that wastes your time.

And in fact, behavioural change _needs_ to be slow so that you value it. If you get where you're going in a day or a week, you won't value it.



To build _any_ habit [you need at least 3 months](TODO).





Principle 1: Consistency Over Intensity
---------------------------------------
Let's say you want to start weightlifting. 

I wave a wand and can guarantee that for the next 2 years you will be physically present in the gym for at least 30 minutes per day, every day, but nothing more. No guarantee that you'll even train, no guarantee on what you do, or that you'll get stronger.

What do you think will happen?

You'll figure it out! 

Maybe the first couple days you won't do anything at all. You'll stare at the machines with no idea how to get started, procrastinate, and leave after your 30 minutes are up.

But eventually you'll get bored of doing nothing (you're locked in for 2 years, after all) and you're going to start trying some stuff out. You'll mess up, learn from the mistakes, and you'll get better.

Within a few weeks, you'll begin to have some ideas on what you want to do and how to do it. You'll start to develop a training regimen yourself, and your curiosity will open: "How do I do this exercise? How do I get better at this thing?" You'll start to seek answers from friends and the internet.

Then you'll probably injure yourself. You'll say, "Well, this sucks." But you're still forced to show up at the gym every day, and by now you've started to enjoy certain things about weightlifting. So you'll start researching how you can rehab yourself, and guard against getting injured again.

By the end of those 2 years, I **know** you will be a better weightlifter than when you went in. How? Simply because that's what humans do! We get bored, try stuff out, and we learn.

And the only thing needed to get you there was showing up consistently.

This is blindingly obvious with babies. A baby doesn't take a course on how to walk or talk. It just tries stuff out, fails a bunch, and eventually figures it out. The only thing the baby consciously did was keep going.

This is insanely liberating: nearly anything you want in life is just some consistent years away.

TODO GRAPHIC OF GETTING STARTED IMAGE

_A image from the Visual Hustle Instagram that I never forgot_

My mantra is therefore "Consistency over intensity" (derived from [this Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/brain-food/august-18-2024/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYou%20don%E2%80%99t%20need,impresses%3B%20consistency%20transforms.%E2%80%9D)").

It's not that intensity isn't useful. But it's a tool, and it can be dangerous for how it can mess up your consistency:

- The pressure to do intense training every day creates anxiety and resistance that can prevent you from getting started, or showing up consistently.
- You train intensely when you feel good, but it becomes your new "normal". Inevitably you get sick or feel low and all of a sudden you're "failing" or "stagnating" because you can't train as intensely.
- It's hard to realize if you're moving at an unsustainable pace until you hit the wall of injury/burnout and are then forced to stop, breaking your consistency.

So be consistent rather than intense.

The weightlifting, guitar, and climbing successes that I mentioned above? These were my commitments to myself:

- At least 30 minutes of physical activity per day (no restrictions on what I do)
- At least 20 minutes of guitar practice per day (no restrictions on what I do)
- At least 1 climbing session per week (no restriction on duration or what I do)

I just kept showing up, over and over.

Much more on this later.

Principle 4: You're Fine
-------------------------
Now, it's hard to take consistent action if you think there's danger. I would not suggest "just figure it out" if you're learning to operate a nuclear reactor. There's real danger there.

But the vast majority of things in today's world are quite safe. Yet we're all so anxious and cautious.

Just look at the messages we get on social media. "Are you STUCK?" "You're WASTING YOUR TIME if..." "How to keep from STAGNATING!" 

It's all about threat. No surprise everyone's so cautious and perfectionist.

We're told that there are all these wrong ways to do things. Helpfully, the person is selling a solution that will fix all that. Just buy their 10-step program, mastermind, whatever.

Unfortunately, this just seems to be the way you have to market in the modern world. "Caution, watch out!" I doubt many 

Problems arise when we start to believe this.

To be clear, I think experts are incredibly useful and can shave a lot of time off the learning process.

TODO you're fine

TODO you're Okay

Principle 2: It's Going To Take A While (And That's A Good Thing)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Modern society has taught us to desire everything Right Now. Yet, behavioural change doesn't work like that.

It's very likely that the behaviour you're trying to change has been in place a long time. You probably built it up over years, and your nervous system has a nearly-automatic response to do the behaviour in certain situations.

This is very clear with addictions. In my case, feelings of social isolation or shame had me reaching for World of Warcraft or Youtube almost without conscious thought.

Effective behavioural change is a slow process of rewriting your default behavioural instincts with the new ones you want.

That slowness _is a good thing_. If you work and suffer for the new behaviour, it's yours forever. You will treasure it.

Sometimes, you have the option to cheat. If you're trying to lose weight, maybe you take Ozempic.

This "works" in that you lose weight, but you didn't actually earn it so it's not yours. You didn't do the hard work of behavioural change. If you stop Ozempic the bad habits you never changed will lead to the weight coming right back.

In my view, this is enslaving yourself: creating a dependency, generating fear ("what if I can't get my pills?"). You got the result before you were ready for it.

This is why I didn't take chemicals like testosterone, antidepressants, antianxiety, etc. The suffering is essential to the growth, so that the success doesn't destroy me.

I've written more about this [here](https://substack.com/home/post/p-154772889).

Principle 3: You Are Very Sensible
----------------------------------
Humans are exceedingly sensible creatures. Every decision you take _makes sense_ to you in that moment. 

It may not be aligned with your long-term goals. It may not make sense to someone else. You may regret it a minute later. But to you, in that moment, it makes sense.

Thus, the root of behavioural change is getting what you want to make sense to you.

Imagine I tell you, "There's a better route to work than the one you're taking. This other one is 15 minutes faster."

Likely you'll nod politely and continue to operate on semi-default each morning, taking your normal route.

But suppose one day you accidentally take a wrong turn, and discover yourself on the route I suggested. As I said, it is indeed 15 minutes faster.

Are you ever going to take your old route again?

Maybe a few times by force of habit, or if there's a coffee shop you like on the way. But if you're late for a meeting, you are absolutely going to take the new route because it _makes sense_ to do so.

I call this distinction "knowing something logically" vs "knowing something emotionally". It's the difference between whether you _should_ do something vs it making sense to you.

If you trusted me, you knew you probably _should_ take the faster route. You knew it logically.

Only when you actually took the route did it make sense to you. You knew it emotionally.

We all know we _should_ floss our teeth, yet most people don't. Why?

Because we don't emotionally feel why a few minutes of yanking a piece of string between our gums is worth the hassle.

But if you've ever had a cavity that came from not flossing... it's not even in question. It makes obvious sense that you don't want to have a toothache like that ever again.

In my case, I knew logically that skipping university lectures to play World of Warcraft was a bad idea. But only when the letter arrived in the mail saying I'd be expelled if I didn't improve did I really _feel_ the urgency.

Behavioural change is all about getting the new behaviour to make sense to you.

Strategies
----------
So putting it all :



















Principle 4: Compare Yourself To Past You, Not Others
-----------------------------------------------------











Tactics: Consistency Over Intensity
-------
- When you feel down, _do the bare minimum and feel proud of it!_ That's what it's there for. Do NOT let any negative emotion creep in. Don't let your baseline adjust - just because you were doing more when you felt good doesn't mean that you can do more always.
- 








Oftentimes, this slow process looks like bringing the moment of awareness that you have a different choice

I model this as a gradual awakening of your awareness.

If you're trying to stop alcohol, you might 


Addictions may have a physiological component (e.g. your body chemically crying out for caffeine, alcohol, heroin, etc) but they _always_ have a psychological component. If they didn't, it wouldn't make sense for you to keep doing the thing that's harming you.

In my case, my default reaction when I felt socially isolated or ashamed was to disassociate from those negative emotions with World of Warcraft and later Youtube.

For you, that might be something like smoking or drinking during stress.

You Have To Want It
-------------------
We all know we "should" floss. But most of us don't. Why?

Because it doesn't make sense to floss.


### Rule 2: You Have Total Control...

### Rule 3: ...And The Environment You Choose Matters A Lot


### Rule X: Measurements aren't strictly necessary, but they're sure helpful

TODO idea is for you to _feel_ the progress


Tactic: take the pressure OFF!!!!

### Going backwards
The good news is that this is always happening passively. Your experiences influence your decisionmaking, and you're always experiencing life. This means that you're always accumulating memories and emotional responses, which means you're always progressing. Even if you don't consciously remember something, your subconscious does.

This means that **you can never stagnate or go backwards**. It's impossible. Even if you feel like you're going back to a previous place, you now have new memories of being in that place before.
