title: "Changing Your Behaviour"
subtitle: "A practical guide to changing your own behaviour"
---

I was not happy with myself as a kid. I felt shy, awkward, lonely, unskilled, and ineffective.

But I am competitive. I want to win.

So I devoted time to shaping myself into the person I wanted to be.

This post shares my lessons I learned crafting myself: how to get rid of bad habits, how to start good ones, and how to keep them.

After reading, you will be better at crafting yourself into the person you want to be.

Why should you listen to me?
----------------------------
I'll try to outline my results.

I started life anxious, skinny, and awkward - both socially and physically. I was not attractive. I was not funny. I didn't seem to have much natural talent.

But I'm a quick learner, I'm introspective, and I want to win. I am also stubborn.



I have an addictive personality. I acquired several bad habits in life which needed work to kill: a videogame addiction, a Youtube addiction, argumentativeness, defensiveness.

I also get bored easily. I've started many new things, but didn't follow through: clarinet, saxophone, piano, German, Russian, Arabic, diving, snowboarding.. and for many years, weightlifting.

As such, I've spent a lifetime thinking about how to shape my behaviour into what I want.

I'm at a spot now where I think I have something valuable to share:

- I speak fluent Portuguese
- I've been weightlifting for 3 years, and recently hit a 100kg bench press
- I've been rock climbing since 
- My finances are automated, and growing without 

This post shares my lessons. Hopefully it helps you too.

I've learned quite a bit about how to upgrade your life: learn new things, acquire new habits, let go of bad ones. This post transmits my toolbox to you.

Who am I? I'm [this guy](https://www.instagram.com/kevinjtoday/). 

Why should you care about my toolbox? Basically: I get bored easily and have an addictive personality, so I've spent a _lot_ of my life trying to quit bad habits, form good ones, and unlock consistency.

A small brag list:

- I became a good enough software engineer to spend 7 years at Palantir, which was considered (at the time I interviewed in 2012) on par with or harder to join than Google.
- I learned fluent Portuguese and live in Brazil.
- I used to speak fluent Spanish (before I traded it for Portuguese) and lived in Mexico City.
- I've lived in 7 countries, and visited more than 40.
- Over years of therapy I've worked through depression with suicidal ideation and [an Anxious-Avoidant attachment style](TODO), and transformed it into a love for myself and an attachment style approaching Secure.
- I worked enough, and learned enough about finances, that I transformed my -$60,000 net worth after graduating college into something where I don't have to work.
- I've kicked addictions to World of Warcraft, videogames, Youtube, and caffeine.
- At previous points in my life I could play clarinet, saxophone, and piano. I can currently play the drums and guitar, and am learning to sing.
- I learned jiu jitsu, then mixed martial arts, then fought in two cage fights.
- I learned to dive, and have over 30 dives logged.
- I taught myself to snowboard.
- I taught myself to rock climb, can climb V5s, and am working on V6s.
- I learned enough about weightlifting and calisthenics that I can bench press 100kg and do muscle-ups and handstands.
- I'm now 5 months sober, and counting.




I've learned a few things about behavioural change in my life. This article will teach you what I've learned.

The ideas are a bit controversial, so here some of my results:

- I was shy and introverted in my youth. People are now surprised when they learn I am still an introvert: "I never would have guessed!"
- I was addicted to World of Warcraft for 5 years, tallying more than 100 days of playtime and nearly getting expelled from university for poor grades. I kicked that habit, and haven't played World of Warcraft since 2011.
- I was addicted to Youtube in my twenties, frequently staying up until 02:00, 03:00, or even 05:00 watching videos I didn't care about when I had to work the next day. I kicked that habit, and can't remember the last time I had a binge.
- I was inconsistent with weightlifting for more than 15 years, never making real progress. I am now 2.5 years consistent, and recently achieved my lifelong goal of a 100kg (220lb) bench press.
- I taught myself to climb, and after 2 years of consistency am now a V5 climber.
- I taught myself guitar, and have been playing almost every day for a year. I most recently completed [an acoustic cover of "Californication" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCp66YPuAMJ/).
- I steadily reduced my alcohol consumption for years, and am now 4 months sober.

All of the above was achieved without chemical assistance. I've never taken psychiatric medication. I've never taken performance-enhancing drugs (unless you count whey protein, creatine, and caffeine). I have taken psychedelics, though my number of uses is around 10 right now and I don't feel I got any lasting behavioural change from them.

Consistency Over Intensity
--------------------------
First controversial opinion: effective change _must_ be a slow process.

We're addicted to quick results these days, and modern marketing helpfully tells us we can have them because it's good for business. 

Forget fast results. Effective change _must_ be a slow process, because if results come too fast then they will enslave you. Consider the following:

- The absurd number of lottery winners who go bankrupt because they don't have the necessary skills to keep such a fortune
- People who lose weight with drugs or surgeries only to quickly put the weight back on because they don't have the habits necessary to keep the weight off
- People who do plastic surgery thinking they'll finally feel good, but then keep needing to go back under the knife
- Trust fund kids who didn't have to work for it, and don't understand the value of the money
- Child stars who didn't work hard enough for the fame and get destroyed by the power it affords

In order for you to own your results instead of your results owning you, it's very important you get them slowly ([I've written about this before](TODO)). The sooner you stop wasting time chasing the quick result illusion, the sooner you can start doing the work required to achieve real sustainable outcomes.

The good news: even though it's not as fast as you hope, it's not as slow as you fear. We all have that voice in our head saying we'll _never_ get there. This, too, is an illusion. 

I estimate you're 2 years of **consistent practice** away from most things you want to achieve in life. For example:

- Learning a skill
- Gaining significant muscle mass
- Losing significant weight
- Changing a negative behavioural trait
- Finding a person to have a healthy relationship with
- Getting the job you want

Certain things tend to take longer - elite sport performance, a medical career, entrepreneurship success - but even with these you can be significantly advanced in 2 years.

How can I be so confident? Because 2 years of 20 minutes of daily practice per day is 243 hours. You practice anything for 243 hours straight and you're _going_ to get pretty good at it (and that's not even factoring in the performance benefits of sleep in between practices).

Let's say you want to start weightlifting. 

I wave a wand and can guarantee that for the next 2 years you will be physically present in the gym for at least 30 minutes per day, every day, but nothing more. No guarantee that you'll even train, no guarantee on what you do, or that you'll get stronger.

What do you think will happen?

You'll figure it out! 

Maybe the first couple days you won't do anything at all. You'll stare at the machines with no idea how to get started, procrastinate, and leave after your 30 minutes are up.

But eventually you'll get bored of doing nothing (you're locked in for 2 years, after all) and you're going to start trying some stuff out. You'll mess up, learn from the mistakes, and you'll get better.

Within a few weeks, you'll begin to have some ideas on what you want to do and how to do it. You'll start to develop a training regimen yourself, and your curiosity will open: "How do I do this exercise? How do I get better at this thing?" You'll start to seek answers from friends and the internet.

Then you'll probably injure yourself. You'll say, "Well, this sucks." But you're still forced to show up at the gym every day, and by now you've started to enjoy certain things about weightlifting. So you'll start researching how you can rehab yourself, and guard against getting injured again.

By the end of those 2 years, I **know** you will be a better weightlifter than when you went in. How? Simply because that's what humans do! We get bored, try stuff out, and we learn.

The only thing needed to get you there was showing up consistently.

But what actually happens in reality, without magic wands? We look to where we want to go and get discouraged. We fear looking dumb. We never start, so we never go anywhere.

The ONLY thing we have to do is keep showing up consistently. You WILL figure the rest out as you go.

I'll dedicate the rest of this article to how you can achieve consistency.

Traps & Illusions
-----------------
There are many, many things that mess up consistency. All of them are limiting beliefs inside your head. Meaning, all of them are under your control.

I'll explain the ones I've noticed, so that you can upgrade them with more productive beliefs.

### Never Arriving, Stagnation, & Going Backwards
We all have that voice inside our head that believes we're never going to arrive where we want, so better not to try to not waste the time and effort. "What's the point of going to the gym... I'll never be fit."

This is a self-fulfilling lie. If you show up every single day, you _will_ arrive. Remember the "2 years" thing.

Two cousin fears are the fear of stagnation and the fear of going backwards. That you _were_ making progress, but now you're not (and you'll be stuck forever so better to quit now).

These don't exist; quitting is the only actual way to stagnate.

How can I be so confident?

Simply: you are _always_ experiencing reality, therefore always creating new memories, therefore always learning. It is physically impossible for you to "stagnate" or "go backwards" because you are always changing as a result of the new experiences you have.

**Even the feeling of being "stuck" or "going backwards" is a new experience from where you were previously, and which motivates you to take action (thereby unsticking yourself)!**

The only way you actually get stuck or go backwards is to give up, thereby breaking your consistency.

I find that these negative beliefs are supported by a false belief that our body is prone to getting stuck or degrading unless we're actively doing something.

This, too, is an illusion supported by the modern overreliance on the thinking mind. Consider the following in your own life:

- Have you ever had the experience of taking a break from something only to find that you're unexpectedly better when you come back?
- After "stagnating" at something, has your ability suddenly and unexpectedly shot up?
- Have you ever slept on something only to wake up with the answer?

Your nervous system is constantly adapting and upgrading to the demands you place on it, _without you doing anything_.

The only thing you have to do is keep showing up, keep demanding that your body be able to do what you want. You'll figure out the rest.

Lastly, it's worth noting that modern marketing plays on these fears to get you to spend money. "Are you STUCK?" "You're WASTING YOUR TIME if..." "How to keep from STAGNATING!" 

Stop letting yourself be controlled by these fears, and trust your body to figure it out.

### Comparison
The illusions of never arriving, stagnation, and going backwards get louder when we look at others. It's tempting to compare ourselves and feel bad for all sorts of reasons - especially in the age of social media.

First, recognize that you often see the results that others have gotten without the sacrifices they made to get there. Nothing is free. Life is a series of choices trading things we have for things we want more. Whatever the other person has, they had to pay for.

When you catch yourself comparing yourself to others, do a base-of-comparison switch. Think of yourself 2 months ago and think, "How am I doing against 2-months-ago me?" **Remember that learning is progress too!** Even if your financial or relationship or physical situation _seems_ worse, I guarantee you learned something very important (because again, you can't stop learning even if you tried).

### Intensity
Another related trap is the belief that you'll stagnate or go backwards unless you're doing high intensity training.

There _are_ some people on the very tip of performance for whom this is undoubtedly true: elite athletes, mathematicians, etc.

You are very likely not one of them. And, you are very likely overestimating the amount of work that you need to do in order to grow.

Worse, the belief that you need all that intensity has a high chance of messing up your consistency. Why:

- When training hard, it's easy to push yourself too hard and burn out or get injured.
- Before you get to training, the anticipation of a hard training session can give you reason to procrastinate.
- You train intensely when you feel good, but it becomes your new "normal". Inevitably you get sick or feel low and all of a sudden you're "failing" or "stagnating" because you can't train as intensely.

I believe that taking the pressure _off_ ourselves is a great idea, and leads to more consistency which generates actual growth.

As such, my mantra is "consistency over intensity" (derived from [this Farnam Street post](https://fs.blog/brain-food/august-18-2024/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYou%20don%E2%80%99t%20need,impresses%3B%20consistency%20transforms.%E2%80%9D)).

I implemented this in my own life with absurdly low success requirements for the things I wanted to do:

- My guitar commitment to myself is just 20 minutes playing on the guitar per day. No restrictions on what I practice, or how hard it feels. I trust myself to get bored which will lead me to challenge myself, and I trust my body to automatically get better over time. Sometimes I practice more than 20 minutes because I'm feeling motivated; other days I do exactly 20 minutes and don't beat myself up for it. I am more than a year consistent.
- My workout commitment is just 30 minutes of physical activity per day. No restrictions on what the activity is. Just like with guitar, I trust my body and my tendency to want to challenge myself. Some days I'm feeling motivated and end up doing yoga, weightlifting, and a run in the same day. Other days I take an extended bike ride and call it good. I'm 2.5 years consistent.
- My climbing commitment is "go the climbing gym once per week". No restriction on what I climb, or how long or intense I climb. I'm two years consistent, and though I could technically turn around and go home as soon as I get to the gym I rarely climb less than two hours.
- My writing commitment to myself is just 20 minutes of writing per day. No restrictions on quality, or what I write because I trust myself. I'm three months consistent.
- My meditation commitment is just 10 minutes per day. I'm nine months consistent.

### I'm Injured/Burnt Out
Inevitably, you _will_ have injuries, burnouts, and other stuff that gets in the way. They can feel like a (very justified) excuse to skip showing up. But careful - your consistency is the only thing that matters; if you skip training you're breaking consistency.

For days like these, I like Jocko Willink's "do what you can" idea. Rather than forcing yourself through something intense, just do whatever you can. It's _okay_ to do the bare minimum. It's okay not to be okay. This is also why it's important for your success requirements to be very low.

I'm strongly opposed to bootcamp/Goggins-style self-flagellation. If you take care of yourself during the times you're down, you won't give up which means you won't break consistency which means you'll keep going which means you'll eventually get where you want to go. I also think it also teaches yourself, "No matter what, I'm here for you so there's no reason to freak out and run away."

### Something's Stopping Me
You might feel, "I'd like to be consistent... but there's _X_ thing stopping me" (where _X_ could be meetings, traffic, travel, a partner, etc.).

This is a seductive lie. By blaming external circumstances, you are pretending to be a victim to the outside world, thereby relieving you of the discomfort of change... and thereby breaking your consistency and keeping you actually stagnant.

You are not a victim. Unless someone is physically forcing you against your will, nobody makes you do anything. Rather, you are choosing to listen and obey. Busyness is a choice.

Stop hamstringing yourself with the victim card, and take ownership for your growth.

I've written more about this [here](TODO LETTER TO MY SON) and [here](TODO TO OWN IT ALL).

### Missing Training
Inevitably, you _will_ miss a training. 

During those times, it's tempting to try and make it up next time: "I'll double my next training session." Don't do this. It amps up the pressure on the next training session, increasing the likelihood that you won't do that one... and turn one missed training session into a spiral of stopping completely.

It's also tempting to beat ourselves up. Don't do this either. If you beat yourself up, you're putting negative pressure on yourself that tends towards, "Well I feel bad so it's best to not do anything."

Instead, just accept that it happened, forgive yourself, resolve not to do it again, and proceed as normal.

### Overenthusiasm
As anyone who's done New Year's goals knows, planning change is fun. We imagine how we'll be when we get where we want to go, and we lay out all the details and goals and steps to get there.

Yet as anyone who's done New Year's goals knows, the actual doing of the daily work is where it all falls apart.

The more things you try to change, and the bigger they are, the more likely you are to get overwhelmed in a month and give up (thereby breaking your consistency).

Most people spend tons of effort planning grand sweeping redesigns that have them insanely overcommitted. It costs just a few seconds to write "Lose 10kg" on your goals and feel excited about it... but months of consistency to make that happen.

Of course, all the effort making that big huge demanding plan is wasted when you get overwhelmed and give up or change plans.

Instead, planning should be fast, simple, and contained: target 1-2 things to change over the next 1-3 months and leave everything else for later. Make the success requirements absurdly easy. If you do them consistently for 1-3 months and find that you're doing well, you can always take on a bit more later. 

It's easy to add things on later; it's catastrophic to overcommit now, get overwhelmed, and quit (thereby breaking your consistency).

For example, my planning for my skills wasn't even written down. It was simply a mental agreement with myself:

- Guitar for 20 minutes per day for the month of January, 2024 (and here I am, more than a year later)
- Go to the climbing gym once per week, until I decide that I don't want to invest in climbing anymore (which hasn't happened)
- Get 30 minutes of exercise daily (no end date; I value health so much that I wanted something I could maintain forever)

The reaction most people give is, "But that's so slow!".

Slow progress is better than fast quitting. Stop falling for the illusion of fast results. With maximum 2 years of consistency (and often much earlier), your life will be transformed.

### Perfectionism
Perfectionism is a flavor of the intensity illusion. Your mind is lying to you, believing that doing something imperfectly _is somehow worse than not doing it at all_. This is ridiculous, because even 0.001 effort is infinitely better than 0 effort.

When you catch yourself resisting taking action because you're worried you'll mess up, remind yourself that _any action at all_ is better than no action.

Here's that [same Visual Hustle image](TODO) from earlier because I believe so strongly in it:

Tactics
-------
So you understand now that consistency is king, and you've seen some common traps that break your consistency. Let's talk tactics I use for achieving consistency.

### Reminders
Sometimes, being consistent is as simple as being reminded that you have to do the thing every day. 

To help, I place reminders in places that I'll visually see (based on Daniel Kahneman's "What You See Is All There Is"). For example:

- I'm trying to gain muscle mass and want to log my body weight every morning before eating. I put my scale in a visually-obvious corner of the bathroom I use every morning after I wake up. I also put a "Log Weight" checkbox widget on the homescreen of my phone (I use and recommend [the Habits app](TODO) for Android users).
- I'm trying to increase various biomarkers, and have supplements I need to take every morning. I put a pill organizer with the pills in view on my kitchen counter, and consciously put it back in view whenever my cleaning lady accidentally leaves it in a cabinet. I also have a "Take Supplements" checkbox widget on the homescreen of my phone.
- I need to do my 20 minutes of guitar every day, so I intentionally bought a floor stand for my guitar and placed it in a prominent spot next to my couch.
- I took the doors off certain cabinets in my apartment so that I'll be reminded to do the things inside (e.g. take my protein supplement, floss).
- I used to do monthly planning sessions. I'd write the goals with checkboxes - e.g. "Talk to 15 strangers" - in dry-erase marker on the mirror next to my apartment door so I'd see them before I leave. I no longer do such rigorous monthly planning, but still write things on the mirror that I want to be reminded of.

I've also tried calendar notifications for things that need to happen regularly at a specific time (e.g. going to bed by 9:30 PM), but I've found that I need to be careful not to have too many notifications else I get desensitized and start to ignore them. Your mileage may vary.

This can work in reverse too. I've stopped drinking for 5 months at time of writing and I'm very happy with the choice, but every time I see the bottles of my home bar (which I keep for guests) on my countertop I think, "Those sure are pretty.. and boy I liked the taste of whiskey." I'm very likely to hide these in a cabinet soon.

### Rewards
I like to set rewards for myself to give an extra consistency boost, especially when just starting a change.

For example: 

- I've currently set a reward for myself that if I get an average 8 hours of sleep per night for this month, I'll buy myself new shoes I've been wanting.
- When I did monthly goals, I'd attach rewards to certain goals that I felt were at risk or which I'd failed to achieve in previous months.

I maintain a list of things I want to make the reward-choosing process easier, ranging from small (ice cream, massage, new pens) to large (DJ controller, DSLR camera). Goals that were more important to me get big rewards. 

For small things, I don't deprive myself in my day-to-day (it's not that I can _only_ eat ice cream if I earn it as a reward). For larger things, I do deprive myself so that I can get a big hit of anticipation when I'm working towards the thing. As a bonus, several of the things I now own have goal stories behind them.

I don't do punishments. I have enough anxious/negative/critical energy inside of my head already, and I believe that I can only love others as much as I love myself. Simple positive reinforcement - and the lack of the reward if I don't complete the goal - has been enough to motivate me.

Consistency Over Intensity
--------------------------






Don't worry about how intense you're going**All you have to do is keep showing up, and you'll figure the rest out.** Don't 

It's not that intensity isn't useful. But it's a tool, and it can be dangerous for how it can mess up your consistency:

- The pressure to do intense training every day creates anxiety and resistance that can prevent you from getting started, or showing up consistently.
- You train intensely when you feel good, but it becomes your new "normal". Inevitably you get sick or feel low and all of a sudden you're "failing" or "stagnating" because you can't train as intensely.
- It's hard to realize if you're moving at an unsustainable pace until you hit the wall of injury/burnout and are forced to stop, breaking your consistency.

So be consistent rather than intense.

The weightlifting, guitar, and climbing successes that I mentioned above? These were my commitments to myself:

- At least 30 minutes of physical activity per day (no restrictions on what I do)
- At least 20 minutes of guitar practice per day (no restrictions on what I do)
- At least 1 climbing session per week (no restriction on duration or what I do)

I just kept showing up, over and over.


Everything in the rest of this article is going to be about how to achieve consistency.




Much more on this later.






Principle 1: Consistency Over Intensity
---------------------------------------
Let's say you want to start weightlifting. 

I wave a wand and can guarantee that for the next 2 years you will be physically present in the gym for at least 30 minutes per day, every day, but nothing more. No guarantee that you'll even train, no guarantee on what you do, or that you'll get stronger.

What do you think will happen?

You'll figure it out! 

Maybe the first couple days you won't do anything at all. You'll stare at the machines with no idea how to get started, procrastinate, and leave after your 30 minutes are up.

But eventually you'll get bored of doing nothing (you're locked in for 2 years, after all) and you're going to start trying some stuff out. You'll mess up, learn from the mistakes, and you'll get better.

Within a few weeks, you'll begin to have some ideas on what you want to do and how to do it. You'll start to develop a training regimen yourself, and your curiosity will open: "How do I do this exercise? How do I get better at this thing?" You'll start to seek answers from friends and the internet.

Then you'll probably injure yourself. You'll say, "Well, this sucks." But you're still forced to show up at the gym every day, and by now you've started to enjoy certain things about weightlifting. So you'll start researching how you can rehab yourself, and guard against getting injured again.

By the end of those 2 years, I **know** you will be a better weightlifter than when you went in. How? Simply because that's what humans do! We get bored, try stuff out, and we learn.

And the only thing needed to get you there was showing up consistently.

This is blindingly obvious with babies. A baby doesn't take a course on how to walk or talk. It just tries stuff out, fails a bunch, and eventually figures it out. The only thing the baby consciously did was keep going.

This is insanely liberating: nearly anything you want in life is just some consistent years away.

My mantra is therefore "Consistency over intensity" (derived from [this Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/brain-food/august-18-2024/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYou%20don%E2%80%99t%20need,impresses%3B%20consistency%20transforms.%E2%80%9D)").

It's not that intensity isn't useful. But it's a tool, and it can be dangerous for how it can mess up your consistency:

- The pressure to do intense training every day creates anxiety and resistance that can prevent you from getting started, or showing up consistently.
- You train intensely when you feel good, but it becomes your new "normal". Inevitably you get sick or feel low and all of a sudden you're "failing" or "stagnating" because you can't train as intensely.

- At least 20 minutes of guitar practice per day (no restrictions on what I do)
- At least 1 climbing session per week (no restriction on duration or what I do)

I just kept showing up, over and over.

Much more on this later.

Principle 4: You're Fine
-------------------------
Now, it's hard to take consistent action if you think there's danger. I would not suggest "just figure it out" if you're learning to operate a nuclear reactor. There's real danger there.

But the vast majority of things in today's world are quite safe. Yet we're all so anxious and cautious.

Just look at the messages we get on social media. "Are you STUCK?" "You're WASTING YOUR TIME if..." "How to keep from STAGNATING!" 

It's all about threat. No surprise everyone's so cautious and perfectionist.

We're told that there are all these wrong ways to do things. Helpfully, the person is selling a solution that will fix all that. Just buy their 10-step program, mastermind, whatever.

Unfortunately, this just seems to be the way you have to market in the modern world. "Caution, watch out!" I doubt many 

Problems arise when we start to believe this.

To be clear, I think experts are incredibly useful and can shave a lot of time off the learning process.

TODO you're Okay

Principle 2: It's Going To Take A While (And That's A Good Thing)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Modern society has taught us to desire everything Right Now. Yet, behavioural change doesn't work like that.

It's very likely that the behaviour you're trying to change has been in place a long time. You probably built it up over years, and your nervous system has a nearly-automatic response to do the behaviour in certain situations.

This is very clear with addictions. In my case, feelings of social isolation or shame had me reaching for World of Warcraft or Youtube almost without conscious thought.

Effective behavioural change is a slow process of rewriting your default behavioural instincts with the new ones you want.

That slowness _is a good thing_. If you work and suffer for the new behaviour, it's yours forever. You will treasure it.

Sometimes, you have the option to cheat. If you're trying to lose weight, maybe you take Ozempic.

This "works" in that you lose weight, but you didn't actually earn it so it's not yours. You didn't do the hard work of behavioural change. If you stop Ozempic the bad habits you never changed will lead to the weight coming right back.

In my view, this is enslaving yourself: creating a dependency, generating fear ("what if I can't get my pills?"). You got the result before you were ready for it.

This is why I didn't take chemicals like testosterone, antidepressants, antianxiety, etc. The suffering is essential to the growth, so that the success doesn't destroy me.

I've written more about this [here](https://substack.com/home/post/p-154772889).

Principle 3: You Are Very Sensible
----------------------------------
Humans are exceedingly sensible creatures. Every decision you take _makes sense_ to you in that moment. 

It may not be aligned with your long-term goals. It may not make sense to someone else. You may regret it a minute later. But to you, in that moment, it makes sense.

Thus, the root of behavioural change is getting what you want to make sense to you.

Imagine I tell you, "There's a better route to work than the one you're taking. This other one is 15 minutes faster."

Likely you'll nod politely and continue to operate on semi-default each morning, taking your normal route.

But suppose one day you accidentally take a wrong turn, and discover yourself on the route I suggested. As I said, it is indeed 15 minutes faster.

Are you ever going to take your old route again?

Maybe a few times by force of habit, or if there's a coffee shop you like on the way. But if you're late for a meeting, you are absolutely going to take the new route because it _makes sense_ to do so.

I call this distinction "knowing something logically" vs "knowing something emotionally". It's the difference between whether you _should_ do something vs it making sense to you.

If you trusted me, you knew you probably _should_ take the faster route. You knew it logically.

Only when you actually took the route did it make sense to you. You knew it emotionally.

We all know we _should_ floss our teeth, yet most people don't. Why?

Because we don't emotionally feel why a few minutes of yanking a piece of string between our gums is worth the hassle.

But if you've ever had a cavity that came from not flossing... it's not even in question. It makes obvious sense that you don't want to have a toothache like that ever again.

In my case, I knew logically that skipping university lectures to play World of Warcraft was a bad idea. But only when the letter arrived in the mail saying I'd be expelled if I didn't improve did I really _feel_ the urgency.

Behavioural change is all about getting the new behaviour to make sense to you.

Strategies
----------
So putting it all :



















Principle 4: Compare Yourself To Past You, Not Others
-----------------------------------------------------











Tactics: Consistency Over Intensity
-------
- When you feel down, _do the bare minimum and feel proud of it!_ That's what it's there for. Do NOT let any negative emotion creep in. Don't let your baseline adjust - just because you were doing more when you felt good doesn't mean that you can do more always.
- 








Oftentimes, this slow process looks like bringing the moment of awareness that you have a different choice

I model this as a gradual awakening of your awareness.

If you're trying to stop alcohol, you might 


Addictions may have a physiological component (e.g. your body chemically crying out for caffeine, alcohol, heroin, etc) but they _always_ have a psychological component. If they didn't, it wouldn't make sense for you to keep doing the thing that's harming you.

In my case, my default reaction when I felt socially isolated or ashamed was to disassociate from those negative emotions with World of Warcraft and later Youtube.

For you, that might be something like smoking or drinking during stress.

You Have To Want It
-------------------
We all know we "should" floss. But most of us don't. Why?

Because it doesn't make sense to floss.


### Rule 2: You Have Total Control...

### Rule 3: ...And The Environment You Choose Matters A Lot


### Rule X: Measurements aren't strictly necessary, but they're sure helpful
TODO example about getting better at a sport
TODO idea is for you to _feel_ the progress


Tactic: take the pressure OFF!!!!

### Going backwards
The good news is that this is always happening passively. Your experiences influence your decisionmaking, and you're always experiencing life. This means that you're always accumulating memories and emotional responses, which means you're always progressing. Even if you don't consciously remember something, your subconscious does.

This means that **you can never stagnate or go backwards**. It's impossible. Even if you feel like you're going back to a previous place, you now have new memories of being in that place before.
