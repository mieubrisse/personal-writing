### Death
Three weeks ago I was looking for a fiction book to read after work, to help me decompress before bed. I found the Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb, saw that it was higly-rated, and dove in.

The books are rough. One Reddit commenter said, "Hobb, rather than write Mary Sues, writes Mary Fuck-you's." I concur: the main character - Fitz - has an inordinate amount of bad luck, his good intentions frequently result in bad outcomes, and when he finally does succeed Hobb gives him just a page or two of victory. Though well-written, the books were stressing me out so much that I stopped the third one 20% of the way through in favor of the plot summary online. This was a wise decision for my mental health.

One of the central themes in the book is duty. The Fitz is the bastard grandchild of a king, and the king feeds, clothes, and educates him in exchange for his service as the king's assassin. Many conflicts in the book are rooted in the tension between Fitz's desire to be his own person and make his own choices, and his obligation to his king.

Fitz's mentors are dutiful, disciplined men of the king, and they have little sympathy for his plights. When Fitz's well-intentioned actions lead to negative consequences, they are quick to label him immature and assign him the blame. Their lack of empathy infuriated me, and was a leading cause of the stress I got from the books. Couldn't they see how hard he was trying? How much he was suffering?

But. 

As my brain chewed the books over, I began to wonder if the mentors weren't right. No matter how much Fitz complains about being trapped in impossible dilemmas, his actions are still the result of his own choices. He chooses, and he has ultimate responsibility. An uncomfortable question grew inside of me: am I Fitz? Am I making shirking responsibility for my actions?

I've long been frustrated by my own perceived lack of self-esteem; it sometimes feels like a curse that I'll never be free of. At various points in my past I've blamed this on:

1. Life, for (I believed) dividing the world into two groups, confident people and unconfident people, and assigning me to the latter
2. My peers in childhood, for not (I felt) welcoming me into their social groups
3. My high school teachers, for not seeing that I was struggling
4. Romantic prospects, for (I believed) ignoring the value that was in me
5. My parents, for their strict and disciplinary approach to child-rearing

I've been an [Extreme Ownership](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057) fan since 2016, and embracing ownership in the workplace gave me what I needed to actually lead teams. Yet all this time I'd been keeping my personality and emotional state apart - I'd behaved as if _those_ things were the fault of others.

The brutal, ugly truth is that it's always been me. 

_I_ chose to stay in playing videogames rather than socialize on the weekends. 

_I_ chose to be snarky and sarcastic because it made me feel powerful and safe, while being honest made me feel weak and exposed. 

_I_ chose to stay on the edges of the school dances, thinking I "couldn't" ask girls to dance, rather than facing my fears and doing it. 

_I_ chose to blame my parents and society during my teenage years, rather than face how I was contributing to the situation.

_I_ chose to use work and travel in my twenties as escape mechanisms to avoid facing my deep loneliness. 

_I_ chose to blame Kurtosis for "stealing" my time because it was easier than saying "no" to protect time for my personal life. 

_I_ chose to make Galen responsible for keeping me happy when the going got tough.

These choices are mine, and what I've reaped today is nothing more than what my choices have sown.

Yet... after death, rebirth. 

### Rebirth
All my accomplishments - my degree, my professional success, my travel, my time spent living in foreign countries, the hearts I did win and the relationships I built, my drumming, my MMA fights, the languages I speak, the business I founded, and the introspective awareness I've gained - that too has all been me. 

I considered myself swept along on the currents of life, a fortunate leaf in the right place and the right time on a large, wide river. Luck is undoubtedly a part of my story, but I made the choices that let me take advantage of it. 

_I_ chose to push through the initial confusion of variables and arrays to learn programming. 

_I_ chose to enroll at UIUC. 

_I_ chose to, rather than room with my childhood best friend, room with a random roommate who eventually introduced me to Palantir. 

_I_ chose to reapply to Palantir after I was rejected the first time. 

_I_ chose to ask Palantir to send me abroad. 

_I_ chose to do therapy for the first time in 2014. 

_I_ chose the path of seduction, and pushed myself to talk to perfect strangers. 

_I_ chose to adopt Extreme Ownership, and therein become a leader.

_I_ chose to leave Palantir and found Kurtosis.

My therapist said the other day, "If you aren't responsible for the losses, how can you take credit for the wins?" I now deeply understand how this must be true.

### Homecoming
I've recently come to appreciate how life is a sequence of elaborate sacrifice rituals. To do it well, you trade something you want less for something you want more. To gain the knowledge and power and respect and success that I seek, I _must_ sacrifice deeply. 

Meaning, I must be broken down. I must fail. I must cry. I must feel defeated. I must wonder if the suffering will ever end. I must be scarred. 

These things are necessary so that when I do gain what I seek, I treasure it and use it wisely, conscious of the deep cost I paid. We know what it looks like to have power without deep sacrifice: it's Justin Bieber and Britney Spears, child actors and lotto winners and trust fund children. Power that hasn't been bought with blood destroys the wielder.
