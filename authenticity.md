Authenticity
============
_Written on 2021-08-07_

I was focused on learning about body language in March of this year, and I ended up on [a video from the excellent Charisma On Command Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5_KFy6qy-A) that breaks down why the actor Chris Hemsworth is so popular with his coworkers. The video provides several high-quality insights, but the one that stuck with me was the following: most people, when faced with the choice of whether or not to do a thing, consider three options:

1. Do the thing and own it (tell others about it)
2. Don't do the thing
3. Do the thing, but hide it

The video asserts that Chris Hemsworth has eliminated the third option - he only consider the first two choices - and this is a source of power for him. I was reminded of Jordan Peterson's maxim, "Never lie," and I decided to experiment with implementing it in my life. It's nearly five months after I launched this campaign, and the results have been profound. In this essay, I'll try to explain why I can't go back to the third option by breaking down what happened and why I think this simple strategy was so transformative.

Some quick background before I go to the examples: I went on a 10-day seduction workshop in Kiev 

was very anxious and unsuccessful with girls when I was growing up. I felt undesirable, an d

First, the results:
* Willing to be videotaped on Eurotour, and as a result getting all the video footage to review
* Owning Eurotour with Cor, and opening up this HUGE depth of knowledge
* Owning open relationships with Cor, and the huge depth of conversation that came from it
* Owning Eurotour with Leo Alfieri, and the personal family stuff and deep connection we formed as a result
* Owning mushrooms with Karla - she said that she can get mushrooms


* Chris Hemsworth, Charisma on Command, most people have three options
* Authenticity aligns all your efforts in one direciton
    * Like head & hips being pointed in the same direction in jiu jitsu
* Makes you realize that you GIVE other people the power to hurt you
    * Authentically owning a thing takes away their power
    * DOES require a bit of Adaptability - confidence that you can handle whatever judgment they throw at you, and that you're fine even if they do judge you
        * Self-fulfilling cycle
* Takes away the ability of people to hurt you
    * E.g. Eurotour, and the positive effects it had on talking with Leo Alfieri
