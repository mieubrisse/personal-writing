I was talking with an engineer friend the other day, and he expressed his discomfort with using AI coding tools because he doesn't know what's in the code.

Before the LLM revolution, most text in a codebase was crafted by hand.

We knew what each line contained because we put it there.

For critical applications, this is necessary: e.g. you _must_ know how your production auth code works, lest you risk a huge and expensive security breach.

But there's a lot of code that's _not_ critical.

For example, I was building [link-summoner](https://github.com/mieubrisse/link-summoner/) as I wrote this post.

It's so low-stakes that it doesn't matter what the code is, as long as it does what I want.

So I didn't look at the code, and kept iteratively refining with Claude in between writing paragraphs until link-summoner did what I want.

Any artist will tell you this is how art is created, too.

You do some things, step back, look, modify, refine. It's an interactive, short-cycle process with immediate feedback - a crucial element of [the flow state](wikipedia on flow state)).

Coding, by contrast, averages loooooong cycles. Even with tab-complete and a good IDE, we're looking at best-case tens of seconds to make a change, and more often minutes or even hours.

In a way, this soothes the average engineer's discomfort (e.g. mine!) with lack of control as s/he places every character.

But it's slow as hell.

With the LLM revolution in full bloom, we can go _so_ much faster... if we're willing to let go of some control.

Not everywhere. Not with everything. Just where it doesn't matter.

To build this habit, we can ask ourselves, "Is 'good enough' enough?"

If the answer is yes... it's probably not critical, and a candidate for AI.

This habit has crossover benefit: it's the same tool used by team leads and product/project managers.

If you're leading a team, you know who on your team is fast vs slow, rigorous vs sloppy. The game becomes choosing the right person for the job.

Which is really the game of life: adapting ourselves to the problem at hand.

But if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

If all you have is rigorous, hand-crafted code...
