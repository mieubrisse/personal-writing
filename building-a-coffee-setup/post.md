### Background
* Was travelling for a long time
* Was only able to have Aeropress
* Did World Aeropress Championship recipe with a metal filter
* Moved to SÃ£o Paulo and now I'm building a Proper Coffee Setup

### Kettle
* Kettle research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbel051H7-s
* As an engineer, I LOVE his quantitative approach - it's like I've been Catholic for years and just discovered the Pope exists
* Bonavita is probably best on balance, including price
    * Found it on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Bonavita-BV382510V-Variable-Temperature-Gooseneck/dp/B005YR0F40/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=bonavita+kettle&qid=1643552222&sr=8-2#customerReviews
    * 6,557 ratings with 4.7/5 stars
    * However, top reviews are saying very negative things about it - rusting out, stopping working, etc.
* Hario seems like the best quality, but also the priciest
    * Turns out it doesn't seem to exist much anymore
    * Found it on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/HARIO-Temperature-EVT-80-HSV-Domestic-Products%E3%80%91%E3%80%90Ships/dp/B07PQG3XSR/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=hario+kettle&qid=1643552225&sr=8-6#customerReviews
    * ...but it doesn't have many reiews, and the reviews are saying it's made in China
    * This also seems to be a problem with Hario; other people are complaining on their other kettles about the made-in-China

### Brewer

### Misc
* Better brewing:
    * Coffee ground bed at the bottom should be FLAT at the end! (NOT conical)
    * Metal filters (e.g. my Aeropress) let through more sediment, which means I'm going to be brewing EXTRA afterwards
* TODO James Hoffman CHANGED THE AEROPRESS RECIPE?!?!?
* Aside: these are fucking awesome: https://www.worldaeropresschampionship.com/shop
