(One conversation always does change everything)

I feel like reading the Navalmanack was a hockey stick moment for me:

Since realizing the importance of compounding, leverage, and judgement through Naval, my appreciation for reading 5x'd. This led me to Ben Franklin's autobiography, which 5x'd my appreciationg for reading again.

I've been on a reading tear like I haven't done since I was a kid, only now I'm reading books that upgrade me instead of junk scifi/fantasy.

And now that I'm downloading Munger's brain, I'm seeing the importance of a latticework of mental models... same as Shane Parrish's (Farnam Street) Clear Thinking and @Don Yuan 's very own David Chapman. Which is only upgrading me further.

And reading Martin Luther King is helping me bridge nonviolence (which came to me through "Way of the Peaceful Warrior" and Mickey Singer's "The Untethered Soul" last year) with the very tactical hard realities of life. It's providing a nuts-and-bolts approach to all this hippie peace stuff.
And now that I have gringowellness, I have an outlet to write about all this stuff.

In writing about it, I am:
helping other people
which makes me feel good and gives me motivation
forcing myself to understand it better
building a "product" that I can now point people to (this is also a Naval concept: media is product)
becoming a better writer, which makes me better at building product

E.g. was talking with a friend who's struggling with similar problems I've struggled with today, and twice I was like "I've written about this; here read this"
Kevin â€” Today at 18:54
And literally all this started from a conversation with @Kimani :
you were the 3rd person to recommend the Navalmanack and I'm like "okay okay I need to read this"
your idea about running your personal life like a business was absolutely instrumental in some of the choices I made to buy back my time, and in how I'm navigating myself today

enormous thanks to you, my man
I'm also actively seeing how AI fits into my workflows to "buy" me back time (ChatGPT being only $20/mo is insanely cheap).

E.g. today I was signing up for a new bank account, and I threw all the terms & conditions docs at ChatGPT and said "give me the salient points, plus any gotchas that I should know about". boom, 2 minutes and I've got it all without needing to read any lawyerese.
AI is massive leverage.
