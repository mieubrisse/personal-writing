We Need To Talk About Glasses
==============================
The world of eye health is far different from what you think

![](./images/image.png)

Like me, you probably grew up hearing from your local eye doctor that glasses are just genetic.

"Nothing you can do!"

But I'd bet money that you wear glasses.

How do I know this?

It's not just that X% of the world wears glasses.

It's because the readers of my blog tend to be science/engineering-y folk, and [glasses use shoots up among the educated](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/10/01/wait-is-everybody-wearing-glasses-nowadays/).

But if you were a construction worker, the chance that you wear glasses is only 1 in 3.

Think about it: _this is really weird_.

If glasses use is genetic, are all the people with the good eyeball genes going into construction?

No.

Turns out, the "glasses are just genetic" thing is plain wrong.

The latest eye research isn't confused: certain behaviours will make your eyes worse.

Meaning, you have a say in whether your eyes get worse.

But that's now how we behave.

Each year we go to the eye doctor, get a prescription number we don't understand, buy more expensive glasses, and repeat the cycle in another 1-2 years.

We treat the fate of our eyes as unknowable.

We let ourselves become victims because we don't understand.

There's are revolution coming in the world of eyecare, but the mainstream isn't talking about it yet.

This article is my attempt to share what I've learned, and _get people talking about this_.

We don't have to be victims!

The research world has figured out a _lot_, and it's not what your local optometrist is telling you.

Buckle up.

My Story
--------
I got my first pair of glasses in 1st grade. An aide had set up a weird machine in the hallway, and called students one by one.

I remember being excited. I thought glasses, like braces, were cool.

When it was my turn, I remember seeing fairly clearly. So I lied, just a little.

I was diagnosed with mild nearsightedness - the technical term is "myopia" - and got a prescription for a pair of glasses.

That day marked the beginning of a treadmill that continued for decades, as whatever myopia I may have invented became very real over the years.

I'd get a new pair of glasses and see clearly for a while.

Then, over the next months, my vision would degrade to ~75% of when I first got the glasses. I'd visit the eye doctor, get told I needed more powerful glasses, get a new prescription, and the cycle would repeat.

As a child I remember asking him why this was happening to me.

"It's genetic," he told me. This seemed to make sense: my mom used to wear thick glasses ("Coke bottle glasses", my dad called them) until she got LASIK surgery.

But occasionally, things wouldn't make sense.

Like my contacts:

When I entered high school, glasses and braces had become decidedly un-cool. So I started wearing contact lenses. There are two types of contacts: soft and hard. The eye doctor recommended I get hard ones, because they helped slow the progression of myopia somehow. I agreed this was a good idea, without realizing that a hard contact lens shouldn't make a difference if myopia was genetic.

Or my lecture experience:

One day in college lecture, a bit bored and frustrated with my glasses, I took them off and started playing with focusing on objects. Wondrously, I discovered that with the right combination of _something_ (focusing? concentrating? I wasn't sure) I could make the professor _slightly_ clearer.

Which is to say, still a blurry blob since my prescription was around -7.0 at that time. But a slightly less blurry blob. It was so notable that I dashed off an incredulous text to my girlfriend, who gave me a nonplussed, "Great babe!"

Or my last experience with that childhood eye doctor:

Now a young engineer in my early twenties, I had come across an article showing that myopia was basically unknown in Eskimo populations until the introduction of reading. (TODO FOOTNOTE - think it was this article but not sure: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-3768.1988.tb02654.x ) I asked that same childhood eye doctor about it, and he brushed it off: "Reading doesn't cause myopia."

But he never gave me a counter-explanation, and it stuck in my brain.

Nonetheless, these little blips in the Matrix soon passed and I returned to life as usual.

By my mid-twenties, my prescription had finally stabilized enough that I could qualify for long-awaited LASIK surgery of my own. In December, 2017 my unaltered eye prescription was taken for clocked for the last time ever at -9.04 left, -7.36 right. I then got a chunk of my eyeball lasered off to fix my vision once and for all.

And it was _magical_.

The pre-surgery testing had revealed that I had high-resolution retinas. The doctor even told me, "You could be a fighter pilot." With the light now properly focusing on my retina, I could read a license plate from a block away.

The first signs that all was not perfect came three years later.

I was in a dim room looking out the window when I noticed a _something_ slide across the light.

Curious, I shifted my eyes back and forth. Yes, there was definitely a little bit of blur swishing around my vision.

I came to know this as a "floater" - a little string of congealed vitreous gel that glides around inside the eyeball, projecting a tiny shadow on the retina.

My first floaters were isolated, but they would soon bring friends. These new neighbors weren't welcome, but I had to learn to tolerate them any time I looked at bright things. I switched my laptop to dark mode.

Then in 2022 I began to notice another oddity. Seemingly at random, maybe once per 1-2 hours, I'd see a slight flash in my extreme left peripheral vision - nearly out of sight. It was as if a small splash of gray-white light would appear and disappear within a second.

I knew this wasn't good.

See, myopia is basically an elongation of your eye. Your eye-ball becomes an eye-oblong.

This elongation means your retina gets stretched tight against the back of your eye. If it stretches too much, or if you take a bad impact to the head, your retina can tear. Then, the gel inside your eye squishes into the hole and peels your retina off the back of your eye like old wallpaper. This is a medical emergency that needs surgery immediately to prevent blindness.

I knew all this from years of doctors peering into my eyes going "Wow, you have really long eyes! You need to be careful about retinal tears."

I also knew that the warning sign of a retinal tear is seeing flashes in your vision.

Understandably, I was scared that I was seeing flashes and ran to the doctor.

Only, he told me, "Your eyes are definitely long, but I don't see any tears." He had no explanation for the flash.

So I went to another doctor. And another. And another.

They all said the same thing: "We're not sure why you're seeing the flash, but we don't see any retinal tears. We'll keep monitoring."

Over 2.5 years I saw 7 doctors - 3 optometrists and 4 retinologists. Nobody could give anything to fix the situation. Just "We'll keep monitoring".

But the symptoms marched on.

My floaters increased to a light snowstorm.

The peripheral flash on the far left turned into a gray-white worm that wriggles occasionally.

I see a little white flash in my left blind spot when I blink in dim light.

My vision - once so sharp - turned blurry.

I felt helpless, as if squeezed by an invisible vice that whispered, "You are going blind."

Just like my childhood eye doctor, the 7 doctors implied my symptoms were the result of some unknowable force of nature. When I asked them whether I was doing something to cause this, they asserted that no, reading and screen time did not cause myopia.

But they did not have skin in the game to keep my eyeballs. I did.

So I burning money on the hope of "If I only find the right doctor, he'll know what's going on" and began to do my own research.
