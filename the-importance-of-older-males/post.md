I dreamt last night that I was in the bedroom of a woman I'd seduced. She was 24 or 25, still living with her parents (who were out of the house), sort of anxious and controlling, and not particularly attractive to me. I was feigning attraction to get through the act of sex, because I wanted to have sex and it seemed like she did too.

Then, we hear a sound: her parents have returned. We begin to dress ourselves in a rush. The door begins to open, and I jump behind it, still socks- and shoe-less. Her father starts to walk in, saying something, and as the opening door hits me I realize I'm caught. I run towards the open window and vault through it to the backyard grass below, footwear in one hand.

The last fading remnants of the day illuminate the quiet suburban neighborhood as I trot through the yard, hop a fence to get back to the street. The front door of her house opens, some 30 meters away. It's her dad: a tall, thin, bony, older man with a shock of white hair. 60, perhaps?

He begins to jog after me as best he can. I am much faster, but I'm still struggling to find a spot to put on my socks and shoes and he knows these yards well. He has no visible weapon and I'm confident in my ability to take him if he should get physical, so I allow him to gain on me as I sit on a front stoop while I get my shoes on.

He's just approaching me with his shambling jog as I finish tying my shoes when he speaks:

"Wait up."

His voice gives me pause. He's slightly winded, but there's no anger or malice in his voice.

"You're a lot faster than me, I'll give you that."

He reaches me now, hands on knees to catch his breath.

"Can I sit with you?"

It's a request, not an order. I nod.

He sits down next to me, and we gaze at the quiet houses in the dusk for a moment.

"I'm not here to yell at you. Just talk to you."

He says these words calmly. His weathered face is kind, and I believe him. He continues:

"Do you love my daughter?"

I lie: "I'm not sure." I know I don't love her, but it seems too much for this moment.

"That's okay, you don't have to. You guys are young, and still figuring it out. Did you use protection?"

We hadn't gotten there but I'd had them in my pocket, ready for the moment. It's very important to me to stay safe, for both of us. I nod.

"That's good. She's very special to me, and I'd hate for anything bad to happen to her."

A pause.

"I was your age once, you know. Sex is fun. You get that tingle up your back..."

He smiles here as he looks out at the neighborhood, undoubtedly recalling the days of his youth. A strange lump is building in my throat. 

"My daughter wanted to have sex with you. She must have been having fun too."

My vision blurs, and tears start to slide down my face.

I was clearly the villain of this story, the rascal there only to tup the girl and disappear. Yet rather than meeting me with foreboding threats of violence - which, by society's standards, is his right - he's here with empathy, inside my world, understanding me.

Wasn't this what my dad was supposed to have done? Why did it come only from the father of the girl I'd wanted to fuck?

He looks at me with a gentle smile, "How are you doing over there?"

Suddenly, a tugging; reality is distorting and evaporating.

I came to, lying in my bed, the air conditioner humming as morning light illuminates my bedroom walls and face wet with tears.

A moment of grief. This kind, wise man had been a dream. He is gone now.

Grief? Why?

Like a lens sliding into place, it was suddenly clear to me that I'd been searching for him my entire life. A symbol - a strong and self-sufficient man that doesn't need anything from me. Doesn't need to judge me, need me to conform to what he wants. He meets me exactly where I. Interacting with him feels like being guided by one much wiser than I: that there _is_ a plan, and it's all a part of the process. I don't have to take it on faith, because he knows and he cares enough to show me.

Where has he gone?

I hear about him when Neil Strauss talks about Rick Rubin in "The Truth", and in the stories of Native American wise men.

I'd wanted to find him in my father. My father is a _good_ man, honest and hardworking, but my story of wandering lost in the world as a highly-paid software engineer, flitting from romantic escapade to romantic escapade, is simply too far from his devout Christian existence of marrying at 25 the woman he'd been dating since 19. He can't help but feel like my life choices are a bad idea, and I'd be better served working as the IT manager of the local public school. I think this is even wise advice worth listening to... but it comes shaped in a way that's easy for him to deliver, not easy for me to receive.

I'd hoped to find it in the men of my jiu jitsu classes over the years - physically strong men, soldiers and operators. Yet I discovered that they were often deeply needy of different things: alcohol, partying, women, appearing tough.

I'd sought it in the coaches of the seduction world, these men who seemed so smooth with the ladies, yet they too were needy: needing to be seen as cool and successful, needing to score with the next hottie.

I'd sought it in my therapists and coaches, and even found something of what I was looking for except that there's always the fact that if I stop paying the acceptance and wisdom and empathy stops. Which I have no problem with - if you're offering something valuable, don't do it for free! It's just not quite the man from my dream.

Perhaps I'm looking for something that doesn't exist: selfless love and empathy for me simply because I am, which maybe only exists as the divine (or at least, a I suspect a Christian would be pointing emphatically at God right now). Perhaps even, it's narcissistic to expect this from a human as it suggests an abnegation of the self in service of me.

Yet, those explanations don't feel right to me. I don't think the man I dreamt of requires a divine nature. Regular old life experience, introspection, and self-growth, compounded over a lifetime into boundaries, patience, self-sufficiency, and compassion for others seems like it would be sufficient.

What feels more true is that we live in a chaotic, over-busy world of men confused about how to find their place and be valuable. Not permanently so - we're not damned or fallen. Just that we have fewer role models because there are more distractions and vices - traps to our self-growth - than ever before. I.e., we have fewer actualized men at all.

In such a world, it's easy to think that more parties, more money, more women, more videogame success, more domination of the other are the way to be a successful man.

I don't buy this anymore. 

Any definition of an actualized male who needs something from the outside world seems enslaved to me. He's not free to meet reality exactly where it is because he's needy of something.

So what exactly are the characteristics of the man I'm searching for?

- He has life experience
- He is non-judgmental
- He is empathetic
- He is calm, and emotionally regulated
- He's accumulated resources
- He's successfully seduced women*
- He is knowledgeable and capable
- He can protect and defend when necessary
- He has won the respect of other men
- He sees the good in others, and offers to help without obligation
- He meets others where they are, demanding nothing of them
- He's a teacher and a guide

_* There's a lot of talk about "toxic masculinity" these days. Any discussion of masculinity - particularly as it relates to femininity and sex - seems to need to tread carefully lest it run afoul of claims of objectifying women. I don't want to enter into any of those waters in this article. I'll note only that feeling capable of winning sex with women has been incredibly important for my own development, and it seems to be the same for most heterosexual men I know. Hence, why it's on my list._
