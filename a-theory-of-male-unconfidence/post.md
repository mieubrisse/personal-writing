title: "A Theory Of Male Boldness"
---

[ ] TODO clarify & sort out the unconfidence/anxiety/wariness
[ ] Perhaps the "introspection" tool?



_Written throughout September and October, 2024_

I've recently become friends with several men who struggle to feel bold. I've wrestled with issues for a lot of my life, so I empathize. I won't claim to have "solved" confidence, as I think it's a spectrum that one gets better at. But I do believe I've worked on the issue for long enough, and made enough personal headway, that I have something to contribute: a theory for what causes unconfidence, and a potential solution.

From here on, I'm going to address you under the assumption that you're a heterosexual male wrestling with unconfidence. I do this because I am this, and so I'm writing to who I know. 

Please remember that this is just my theorizing, offered in the hopes that it's useful to you. I am not a therapist and this isn't a substitute for therapy (which I highly recommend).

Confidence & You
----------------
First, what exactly _is_ confidence? 

For someone who doesn't feel confident, I know confidence might seem like a magical gift bestowed on others...  but not you. Confident men seem to have superhuman powers: seeming fearlessness, decisiveness, a decidedness of purpose, and a noted lack of fretting over past decisions. 

If you're like me, you might have felt that these men are the "winners" in the competition that is masculinity in today's world. "Why," you might wonder, "was I denied the gift?"

But a confident man can't know the future any more than you can. Rather, **the confident man believes that whatever happens will be okay**. 

He believes this because he has experiences telling him it will be so, and therefore it only makes sense to him to be bold.

This "makes sense" aspect is important. 

Think of your childhood and adolescence (ages 0-18), and answer these questions:

- Were you criticized or punished for not achieving what your parents or social environment (e.g. school) wanted?
- When your desires differed from what your parents or social environment wanted, were you supported in those differences or forced to conform?
- Did challenging the rules feel scary or overwhelming?
- When you felt hurt, drained, or low, did you have an emotionally safe, nourishing, and restorative place to recharge?
- Did taking risks (e.g. talking to the girl you liked) not seem to work out for you?

If you resonate with one or more of these, consider this: the first ~18 years of your life are your most vulnerable. You don't have any financial resources of your own, you're not legally allowed to sign contracts, you don't understand how the world works, you don't have any value to offer, the planning & execution functions of your brain are still underdeveloped, you haven't yet learned social skills, and you're physically small & weak so you can't win fights.

When you're that vulnerable and your parental/social environments demand that you conform to their reality rather than supporting you in defining your own, _it only makes sense_ that you developed the caution & watchfulness that now presents as unconfidence. You were rewarded for discovering and obeying the rules of someone else's game. Perhaps, even punished for defining your own game.

Just as the confident man's past experiences lead him to the conclusion that boldness makes sense, your experiences lead you to the conclusion that wariness makes sense. 

Our behaviours might seem crazy from the outside, and they might not be what's long-term optimal for us, but they always _make sense_ to us in the moment.

Blazing New Trails
------------------
You are no longer vulnerable like you were in the first 18 years of your life. You have resources of your own, and you no longer need to conform to parents or the school system. You likely realize that the cautiousness which was so essential when you were younger is now blocking you from taking certain risks that would be beneficial to you - talking to the women you want, pursuing job opportunities you want, standing up for yourself like you want, attempting new skills, etc. 

You'd like to become confident.

The great news is, my experience tells me you absolutely can. To understand how, let's go back to the "makes sense" aspect of behaviour. 

If unconfidence as a strategy was only a result of your past childhood & adolescence environment, you would have discarded unconfidence now that you're an adult who's out of that environment. Yet, unconfidence persists. There must be something continuing to reward you for it.

To explore this, put yourself in the following scenarios and check in with what your inner voice is saying:

1. You're in a cafe, and a beautiful woman walks in. I urge you to go and talk to her.
1. Your boss tells you that they're going to take you out of your current role, and put you in charge of a project that's not doing well.
1. You're coming to meet me for coffee. While you're en route, I let you know that I'm actually with a group of my friends here that I'll introduce you to.
1. I, as your friend, tell you about a business deal I discovered: I've learned that a house is being sold privately at a significantly discounted price relative to the market. I offer for us to consider buying the house together, and flipping it for a profit.

What are you feeling in these scenarios? Any anxiety or trepidation? Caution? Resistance? The desire to decline?

If so, this makes sense given what you learned growing up. The environment of your younger years trained you to be very good at detecting and avoiding possible negatives (punishment, criticism), so you continue to do so today. "No" is the default, because it minimizes risk.

Now let's add some information on top of each scenario:

1. You saw another man talk to the woman in the café, and she seemed to be in a bad mood - brushing him off in dismissive way.
1. Your boss put another person in charge of the project, and it turned into a bunch of headache for that person.
1. When you arrive, you learn that my friends have known each other for years and they spend a lot of time talking amongst themselves. You feel awkward, and not included.
1. I do the deal on my own, and I struggle to sell the house for a while. When I eventually do sell it, it's barely for profit.

Now how do you feel about each scenario? Relieved? Justified in your caution? Validated?

If so, _this_ is what's keeping you chained to your strategy of unconfidence. You continue to reward yourself for identifying and avoiding the negative.

I designed the outcomes of the proposed scenarios to tap into your likely fears, but notice the alternate outcomes I omitted:

1. You talk to the woman in the café, and she's warm and kind. She seems to like you, and you exchange contact information to set up a date.
1. You take charge of the problematic project, and the project's issues resolve under your guidance. Your boss is impressed with your skill, and would like to give you a bonus for your handling of the situation.
1. When you arrive, my friends welcome you into the group and conversation flows easily. You enjoy chatting to them, and exchange contact information to hang out in the future. The seeds for some new friendships are planted.
1. You go in on the house deal with me, and we flip the house in a few months for a 30% return on investment.

Did you contemplate these positive outcomes when you considered the original scenarios? If you did, did they seem too pie-in-the-sky or naive relative to the risks?

Focusing on the negative (which, again, is a _rational_ response to the environment you grew up in) creates a pain-avoidant reality where we can either feel neutral or negative but not good. If we lack something and focus on the lack, we feel negative (pain). If we fix the lack, we get back to neutral. If a negative thing we're worrying about comes to pass, we feel bad because the negative thing occurs (pain). If we successfully anticipated and avoided it, we feel neutral (but not good) because we avoided pain.

Unfortunately, this mindset tends to discard upsides... which means risk-taking doesn't feel worth it.

To retrain your mind and build your confidence, you're going to need to increase power to your positivity-detection circuits, and reduce power to your negativity-detection circuits. 

With consistent practice, your observed positives will start to outweigh your observed negatives. You will become bolder because you'll realize how any outcome is Okay, and it will _make sense_ to be bolder. 

Your confidence will start to heal.

Tactics
-------
At this point you might be saying, "Okay, great, but how do I actually do that?" As of 2024-10-04, I employ two concrete tools: the Positive Voice and Positivity Journalling.

### Positive Voice
If you're like I was for much of my life, there's a voice running all day long in your head. It says things like, "This won't work", "You aren't good enough", "You're so emotional", "Everyone is better than you", etc. I call this the Critical Voice. It's your inner bully, that focuses on the negative, and I've [written a lot about it here](../the-positive-voice/post.md).

In order to begin the healing process, you must:

1. Become aware of the Critical Voice, and when it's speaking
2. Turn down the volume on it
3. Construct a Positive Voice (your inner cheerleader)
4. Give the Positive Voice volume

Note: for men like myself, listening to this Critical Voice is somehow weirdly comforting (I don't yet know why; probably a topic for another post). Meaning, it's going to feel _hard_ to turn down the volume on the Critical Voice. 

You're going to feel like you're going soft on yourself, or being lazy. Focusing on the negative will feel rational, and focusing on the positive might feel wishful or naive. 

This all makes sense: focusing on the negative _was_ rational, when you were young and vulnerable.

But if you're reading this article, you don't want to be imprisoned by low confidence any further. And if a tool is effective, you don't need to take it on faith; it should produce results. 

So run an experiment: commit to yourself for one day that only positive self-talk is allowed. 

Any time you catch negative self-talk - e.g. beating yourself up, comparing yourself unfavorably to others, predicting catastrophe - replace it with positivity. This means channelling your inner cheerleader, building yourself up, telling yourself you can do it, focusing on the potential positive outcomes... _even if_ it feels silly or lame.

Pay attention to how you feel at the start of the day vs at the end. If the Positive Voice tool does indeed work, the inside of your head will feel like a slightly nicer place to be. But you have to feel it for yourself to know intuitively that the tool works.

### Positivity Journalling
Sometimes, despite trying to maintain my Positive Voice in my head, I still end up in states where I feel anxious or bummed out or not good enough.

When this happens, I turn to Positivity Journalling. Simply, I sit down with my pen-and-paper journal, and start bullet-pointing out all the things that are good or positive in my life. Anything is fair game, and it doesn't matter if I've written it down before. The only rule is, no negativity allowed. 

I keep doing this until I feel the journalling has run its natural course. Remember, even writing one thing is better for training your inner positivity than writing zero things.

An example I wrote right now:

```
- I'm doing this Positivity Journalling right now, which is helping me reset as I write this article
- The weather is nice and cool, which is a much-needed change from the heat of the last few days
- I'm putting time into writing this article, chipping away at getting it done
- My workspace is nice and cozy, and the lights of São Paulo are beautiful out my window
- I'm excited to see my friends tomorrow night, watch the UFC fight together, and laugh and talk a bunch of shit
- I had a delicious specialty coffee this morning
- I had a great journalling session this morning, where for the very first time I tried searching for the good/positives in people with whom I've been fighting
- A friend I admire reached out to me today for my help with talking to women he likes in public, because he feels I do a good job with it. This makes me feel useful & valued
- Doing this journalling, I've realized a couple things I'd forgotten about
```

The list itself isn't actually important. What matters is the act of calling to mind complete thoughts about what's going right in your life. 

Some tips:
- The pen-and-paper aspect is best because the slow nature of handwriting forces you to feel the thing (though digital works if you don't have pen and paper).
- Sometimes, it can feel like everything is going to hell and you have nothing to write about. But there's a neat truth to reality: you're always experiencing which means you're always learning, and learning is always positive because it provides the fuel for growth. So even if every single thing in your life is going wrong, ask, "What have I learned recently?" You might only be learning what not to do, _but that's still learning and is still positive_.
- It's tempting to sneak negativity into the journalling in subtle ways (after all, listening to the Critical Voice is weirdly addictive). This can take the form of caveats that steal the joy, e.g.: "I got a raise... but it's been a long time coming" or "I made a breakthrough in therapy... about fucking time". This negativity must not be allowed either. Only positivity.

Like with the Positive Voice, an effective tool must deliver results. Try this out, and compare: how did you feel before the journalling vs after? Do you feel better?

Tactics In Practice
-------------------
The Positive Voice and Positivity Journalling are all well and good, but what might they look like in practice? Here's an example from my own life:

The past week I've been feeling a bit bummed out:
- While my weightlifting numbers are going up, my weight has been going down. I'm stronger by the numbers, but I'm feeling & looking skinnier than I did a month ago.
- There are several successful, good-looking, confident men that I follow on Instagram. I (who's currently on sabbatical from work) find myself feeling sort of bummed out after being on Instagram whenever one of their posts shows up (though the cause doesn't rise to my consciousness unless I find 
- 




The above tactics are tools to help you rebuild your self-esteem. Like anything in life, they come with ups and down.s

Conclusion
----------
With practice, you will rewire your brain. Life will feel easy, because you will feel like you're navigating a series of win-win's. Not because the chances of your preferred outcome increase, but because you'll be able to extract the good from whatever happens... just like the confident men who are okay with any outcome.

As Nelson Mandela put it, "I never lose. I either win or I learn."

It won't happen overnight. After all, you've spent a decade or more training your negativity focus. But if you keep up the practice, it _will_ happen. 

Beware - your confidence-building training can itself become a target for the Critical Voice: "You're not making any progress, you'll never become confident, this is stupid, maybe you're going backwards..." The Critical Voice will focus on the end result, and highlight how very, very far you feel from it.

But a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step... followed by another, followed by another. When you feel the Critical Voice telling you that you'll never arrive, ignore it and switch your focus to yourself last week or last month. Are you focusing more on positivity? Or, perhaps, have you learned how much you've _not_ been positive?

If the answer is yes, _keep going_ - you're advancing, growing, and becoming better.

Best of luck on your journey, brothers.
