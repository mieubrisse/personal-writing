title: "A Theory Of Male Cautiousness"
---

[ ] TODO clarify & sort out the unconfidence/anxiety/wariness
[ ] Perhaps the "introspection" tool?



_Written throughout September and October, 2024_

I've recently been chatting with several friends who've told me about problems with overthinking. They feel confident and bold in their best moments, but report feeling unsure and tentative more than they'd like. Worrying is a common complaint.

My life has been a long journey battling against self-doubt, worrying, and lack of confidence. I won't claim to have "solved" the issue - I believe it's a skill that one is constantly practicing and refining. But I do believe I've worked on the issue for long enough, and made enough personal headway, to have something to contribute.

Namely, a theory for why men get into this state and tactics for how to get them out of it.

From here on, I'm going to address you under the assumption that you're a heterosexual male wrestling with overthinking and cautiousness. I do this because this is my experience, so I'm writing to whom I know. 

Please remember that this is just my theorizing, offered in the hopes that it's useful to you. I am not a therapist and this isn't a substitute for therapy (which I highly recommend).

Overthinking & You
----------------
First, what exactly _is_ overthinking?

For someone who feels compelled to overthinking or worry, I know boldness might seem like a magical gift bestowed on others...  but not you. Bold men seem to have superhuman powers: seeming fearlessness, decisiveness, a decidedness of purpose. A noted lack of fretting over past decisions. 

If you're like me, you might have felt that these men are the "winners" in the competition that is masculinity in today's world. "Why," you might wonder, "was I denied the gift?"

The bold man can't know the future any more than you can. Instead, the secret to his boldness is **he believes whatever happens will be okay**. 

In short, his relationship to the volatility of the future is, "This is fine."

The bold man does not arrive at this belief through arbitrary decision, however. He believes it because his past experiences with volatility have been fine - perhaps even positive. It only makes sense to him to embrace volatility.

This "makes sense" aspect is important. 

Think of your childhood and adolescence (ages 0-18), and answer these questions:

- Were you criticized or punished for not achieving what your parents or social environment (e.g. school) wanted?
- When your desires differed from what your parents or social environment wanted, were you supported in those differences or forced to conform?
- Did challenging the rules feel scary or overwhelming?
- When you felt hurt, drained, or low, did you have an emotionally safe, nourishing, and restorative place to recharge?
- Did taking risks (e.g. talking to the girl you liked) not seem to work out for you?

If you resonate with one or more of these, consider this: the first ~18 years of your life are your most vulnerable. You don't have any financial resources of your own, you're not legally allowed to sign contracts, you don't understand how the world works, you don't have any value to offer, the planning & execution functions of your brain are still underdeveloped, you haven't yet learned social skills, and you're physically small & weak so you can't win fights.

When you're that vulnerable and your parental/social environments demand that you conform to their reality rather than supporting you in defining your own, _it only makes sense_ that you developed caution and wariness. You were rewarded for discovering and obeying the rules of someone else's game. Perhaps, even punished for defining your own game.

You were incentivized to think ahead.

Just as the bold man's past experiences lead him to the conclusion that boldness makes sense, your experiences lead you to the conclusion that thinking more makes sense.

Our behaviours are _not_ illogical. They might seem crazy to a third-party observer, and they might not be what's long-term optimal for us, but there are good reasons for why we do what we do.

Blazing New Trails
------------------
You are no longer vulnerable like you were in the first 18 years of your life. You have resources of your own, and you no longer need to conform to parents or the school system. You likely realize that the cautiousness which was so essential when you were younger is now blocking you from taking certain risks that would be beneficial to you: talking to the women you want, pursuing job opportunities you want, standing up for yourself like you want, attempting new skills, etc. 

You'd like to become bold.

The great news is, my experience tells me you absolutely can. To understand how, let's go back to the "makes sense" aspect of behaviour. 

You no longer adhere to the bedtime that your parents imposed. You're out of that environment and don't need to adhere to your parents' rules anymore, so you've dropped it because it doesn't make sense for you. 

Just like the bedtime, we'd expect you to drop overthinking if it no longer makes sense for you. Yet, your overthinking persists. There must be something continuing to reward you for it.

To investigate this, let's imagine some scenarios. After you read each one, close your eyes for a moment and really experience what it's like to be inside the scenario. Pay particular attention to how your feelings & emotions progress over the scenario.

### The Cafe
You and I are reclining at a window table of a small, busy cafe. The lights cast a warm yellow shine across the white-painted wooden walls, and the whirr of the espresso machine periodically slices through the buzz of the cafe's patrons conversing. The aroma of brewing coffee mixes with the smell of bacon from the kitchen. 

You hear the door swish open behind you, and my eyes leaver yours to start tracking something. You glance around, and see a beautiful woman walking up to the counter. She's gorgeous: long, glossy brunette hair, blue-green eyes, black heels, an elegant but well-fitted navy blue dress hugging her slim curves. We both watch as she orders her coffee and stands looking at her phone as she waits. 

I turn to face you: "Get up, and go talk to her."

### The Project
It's a Tuesday afternoon and you're in the middle of work. You get a message from your boss on your company's messenger service: "Got a moment to chat?" Such a vague message is odd. "Sure - what's up?" "Zoom?" You find a quiet place and hop on the link he sends. He speaks first: "Hey, how's it going? So sorry for such short notice; I just got out of back-to-back meetings. Do you know Project X?" 

Of course, you tell him. Everyone does. It's a project happening in your sister department for over a year now, and it's a mess. The team is famous for working until 9, 10, or even 11 PM most nights of the week. They were supposed to have finished four months ago, there are rumors of difficult personalities on the team, and two people have already quit. 

"I'm sorry, this is really going to suck but... the project manager there just resigned. I need you to stop what you're doing ASAP, and get Project X over the line. Leadership is thinking about cancelling the project entirely."

You sit in silence for a moment. "Does this come with a compensation increase?" You know company finances are tight right now, but this is Project X.

Your boss has a pained look on his face. "I really, really wish I could say yes... but I have no budget at all for it right now. It's something we gotta Just Do It." His emphasis makes it clear the Nike reference is intentional.

He pauses, and continues, "I know it's a lot to ask. If you really don't want it, I'll start looking for someone else. I just thought of you first."

### The Invite
It's a bright, sunny morning with just a hint of chill. I've invited you for a breakfast bagel at a restaurant downtown, and you've just gotten into your Uber for the 10-minute ride. Your phone vibrates. It's message from me: "Hey just a heads-up that I'm here with a group of friends. I'll introduce you."

### The Business Deal
1. I, as your friend, tell you about a business deal I discovered: I've learned that a house is being sold privately at a significantly discounted price relative to the market. I offer for us to consider buying the house together, and flipping it for a profit.

---

What are you feeling in these scenarios? Any anxiety or trepidation? Caution? Resistance? The desire to decline?

If so, this makes sense given what you learned growing up. The environment of your younger years trained you to be very good at detecting and avoiding possible negatives (punishment, criticism), so you continue to do so today. "No" is the default, because it minimizes risk.

Now let's add some information on top of each scenario:

### The Cafe
Right after I speak, a man from a table to the woman's side stands up. He takes a step in front of her, smiles, and says something you can't hear. She glances up from her phone, frowns, and responds with a furrowed brow. The man's body language closes slightly, he speaks once more, and walks back to sit down at his table.

### The Project
After thinking about it, you turn down the offer and your boss selects another member of your team. They do their best, but after 4 months of more late nights Project X is declared a loss. Leadership cancels the project.

### The Invite
You walk through the door of the bagel place, and see me in the midst of a group of six people. I smile and gesture you over, introducing you to the group and telling you the names of each person. There aren't any seats next to me, so you sit down at the open end of the table. My friends are polite, but they spend a lot of time talking amongst themselves. You learn that they've known each other for years; there are many in-jokes and past experiences that you don't get. You don't feel very included, and the breakfast passes with you on periphery.

### The Business Deal
1. I do the deal on my own, and I struggle to sell the house for a while. When I eventually do sell it, it's barely for profit.

---

Now how do you feel about each scenario? Relieved? Justified in your caution? Validated?

If so, _this_ is what's keeping you chained to your strategy of unconfidence. You continue to reward yourself for identifying and avoiding the negative.

I designed the outcomes of the proposed scenarios to tap into your likely fears, but notice the alternate outcomes I omitted:

### The Cafe
After I speak, you hesitate for a second and then stand. You walk to her, a flutter in your chest. Reaching her, you say, "Hi. I know this is random, but you're dressed so well that I had to risk embarrassing myself to say hello." She looks up from her phone with those luminous eyes, and smiles. "Thank you! Today's been so stressful.. you just made my day." You reply, "Too much work?" "Yess.. I'm a paralegal, and we're working a big case. This is the only moment I've had to get a breath of fresh air." The chat continues for a few more moments, before she says, "I have to get back to work, but it was nice meeting you." She smiles, but hesitates for a second. You recognize the cue: "Do you have an Instagram? Maybe we can get a coffee together when you're not slammed with work." She smiles again and says, "I'd be okay with that." You take her Instagram, and walk back to our table.

### The Project
Despite your reservations, you accept charge of Project X. It takes work, but under your leadership you are able to work through the personality differences, stop the late nights, and get team morale back up. Coworkers who used to speak with trepidation about the Project X team are marvelling at the turnaround. Project X finishes successfully three months later, and your boss gives you triple your normal yearly bonus in appreciation.

### The Invite
1. When you arrive, my friends welcome you into the group and conversation flows easily. You enjoy chatting to them, and exchange contact information to hang out in the future. The seeds for some new friendships are planted.

### The Business Deal
1. You go in on the house deal with me, and we flip the house in a few months for a 30% return on investment.


Did you contemplate these positive outcomes when you considered the original scenarios? If you did, did they seem too pie-in-the-sky or naive relative to the risks?

Focusing on the negative (which, again, is a _rational_ response to the environment you grew up in) creates a pain-avoidant reality where we can either feel neutral or negative but not good. If we lack something and focus on the lack, we feel negative (pain). If we fix the lack, we get back to neutral. If a negative thing we're worrying about comes to pass, we feel bad because the negative thing occurs (pain). If we successfully anticipated and avoided it, we feel neutral (but not good) because we avoided pain.

Unfortunately, this mindset tends to discard upsides... which means risk-taking doesn't feel worth it.

To retrain your mind and build your confidence, you're going to need to increase power to your positivity-detection circuits, and reduce power to your negativity-detection circuits. 

With consistent practice, your observed positives will start to outweigh your observed negatives. You will become bolder because you'll realize how any outcome is Okay, and it will _make sense_ to be bolder. 

Your confidence will start to heal.

Tactics
-------
At this point you might be saying, "Okay, great, but how do I actually do that?" As of 2024-10-04, I employ two concrete tools: the Positive Voice and Positivity Journalling.

### Positive Voice
If you're like I was for much of my life, there's a voice running all day long in your head. It says things like, "This won't work", "You aren't good enough", "You're so emotional", "Everyone is better than you", etc. I call this the Critical Voice. It's your inner bully, that focuses on the negative, and I've [written a lot about it here](../the-positive-voice/post.md).

In order to begin the healing process, you must:

1. Become aware of the Critical Voice, and when it's speaking
2. Turn down the volume on it
3. Construct a Positive Voice (your inner cheerleader)
4. Give the Positive Voice volume

Note: for men like myself, listening to this Critical Voice is somehow weirdly comforting (I don't yet know why; probably a topic for another post). Meaning, it's going to feel _hard_ to turn down the volume on the Critical Voice. 

You're going to feel like you're going soft on yourself, or being lazy. Focusing on the negative will feel rational, and focusing on the positive might feel wishful or naive. 

This all makes sense: focusing on the negative _was_ rational, when you were young and vulnerable.

But if you're reading this article, you don't want to be imprisoned by low confidence any further. And if a tool is effective, you don't need to take it on faith; it should produce results. 

So run an experiment: commit to yourself for one day that only positive self-talk is allowed. 

Any time you catch negative self-talk - e.g. beating yourself up, comparing yourself unfavorably to others, predicting catastrophe - replace it with positivity. This means channelling your inner cheerleader, building yourself up, telling yourself you can do it, focusing on the potential positive outcomes... _even if_ it feels silly or lame.

Pay attention to how you feel at the start of the day vs at the end. If the Positive Voice tool does indeed work, the inside of your head will feel like a slightly nicer place to be. But you have to feel it for yourself to know intuitively that the tool works.

### Positivity Journalling
Sometimes, despite trying to maintain my Positive Voice in my head, I still end up in states where I feel anxious or bummed out or not good enough.

When this happens, I turn to Positivity Journalling. Simply, I sit down with my pen-and-paper journal, and start bullet-pointing out all the things that are good or positive in my life. Anything is fair game, and it doesn't matter if I've written it down before. The only rule is, no negativity allowed. 

I keep doing this until I feel the journalling has run its natural course. Remember, even writing one thing is better for training your inner positivity than writing zero things.

An example I wrote right now:

```
- I'm doing this Positivity Journalling right now, which is helping me reset as I write this article
- The weather is nice and cool, which is a much-needed change from the heat of the last few days
- I'm putting time into writing this article, chipping away at getting it done
- My workspace is nice and cozy, and the lights of São Paulo are beautiful out my window
- I'm excited to see my friends tomorrow night, watch the UFC fight together, and laugh and talk a bunch of shit
- I had a delicious specialty coffee this morning
- I had a great journalling session this morning, where for the very first time I tried searching for the good/positives in people with whom I've been fighting
- A friend I admire reached out to me today for my help with talking to women he likes in public, because he feels I do a good job with it. This makes me feel useful & valued
- Doing this journalling, I've realized a couple things I'd forgotten about
```

The list itself isn't actually important. What matters is the act of calling to mind complete thoughts about what's going right in your life. 

Some tips:
- The pen-and-paper aspect is best because the slow nature of handwriting forces you to feel the thing (though digital works if you don't have pen and paper).
- Sometimes, it can feel like everything is going to hell and you have nothing to write about. But there's a neat truth to reality: you're always experiencing which means you're always learning, and learning is always positive because it provides the fuel for growth. So even if every single thing in your life is going wrong, ask, "What have I learned recently?" You might only be learning what not to do, _but that's still learning and is still positive_.
- It's tempting to sneak negativity into the journalling in subtle ways (after all, listening to the Critical Voice is weirdly addictive). This can take the form of caveats that steal the joy, e.g.: "I got a raise... but it's been a long time coming" or "I made a breakthrough in therapy... about fucking time". This negativity must not be allowed either. Only positivity.

Like with the Positive Voice, an effective tool must deliver results. Try this out, and compare: how did you feel before the journalling vs after? Do you feel better?

Tactics In Practice
-------------------
The Positive Voice and Positivity Journalling are all well and good, but what might they look like in practice? Here's an example from my own life:

The past week I've been feeling a bit bummed out:
- While my weightlifting numbers are going up, my weight has been going down. I'm stronger by the numbers, but I'm feeling & looking skinnier than I did a month ago.
- There are several successful, good-looking, confident men that I follow on Instagram. I (who's currently on sabbatical from work) find myself feeling sort of bummed out after being on Instagram whenever one of their posts shows up (though the cause doesn't rise to my consciousness unless I find 
- 




The above tactics are tools to help you rebuild your self-esteem. Like anything in life, they come with ups and down.s

Conclusion
----------
With practice, you will rewire your brain. Life will feel easy, because you will feel like you're navigating a series of win-win's. Not because the chances of your preferred outcome increase, but because you'll be able to extract the good from whatever happens... just like the confident men who are okay with any outcome.

As Nelson Mandela put it, "I never lose. I either win or I learn."

It won't happen overnight. After all, you've spent a decade or more training your negativity focus. But if you keep up the practice, it _will_ happen. 

Beware - your confidence-building training can itself become a target for the Critical Voice: "You're not making any progress, you'll never become confident, this is stupid, maybe you're going backwards..." The Critical Voice will focus on the end result, and highlight how very, very far you feel from it.

But a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step... followed by another, followed by another. When you feel the Critical Voice telling you that you'll never arrive, ignore it and switch your focus to yourself last week or last month. Are you focusing more on positivity? Or, perhaps, have you learned how much you've _not_ been positive?

If the answer is yes, _keep going_ - you're advancing, growing, and becoming better.

Best of luck on your journey, brothers.
