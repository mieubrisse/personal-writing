Surfer Steve, Ego Death, And The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Hiveminds
======================================================================================
Behind the zeitgeist, but catching up

### The AI Work Factory
Last year I published [The Goal Is Unique Work](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/the-goal-is-unique-work) and [Be Rembrandt](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/be-rembrandt).

The writing process made me realize how inefficient my own writing, and general life TODO management was.

It got me thinking: I should have an "AI work factory" that does the gruntwork of transforming my unique thoughts into actuality.

I started it [here](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/building-the-factory), then wrote about tuning it [here](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/inputs-not-outputs)...

...then did nothing else.

Meanwhile, the world progressed.

On January 1st, Steve Yegge [launched Gastown](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04).

"Oh shit," realizes I, "AI work factories are becoming real!"

### Background
In 2011 my girlfriend told me that her cousin's boyfriend was into this thing called "Bitcoin mining" and suggested I check it out.

I Google'd it on my custom-built gaming PC with turbocharged GFX card running on college dorm-provided electricity... and thought "Mm seems complex; I don't get it." I dropped it.

After getting obliterated by that Richter 10 blunder and reading more Talebian Black Swan theory, I've been keeping my eye on the horizon to catch that next wave.

I was convinced - stubbornly, determinedly, horribly convinced - we were riding one at my last company, doing container orchestration in 2020.

Turns out.. container orchestrators were the hot shit in _2013_.

We were so, so late and I was so, so wrong.

Again.

### The Wave
So when Yegge launched Gastown, I thought "This is my wave! I'm trained in programming, financially comfortable, have loads of free time, and I've been thinking about AI work factories!"

Only, I thought Gastown was overly complex.

I thought there was the opportunity to build a simpler, more approachable AI work factory: a simple technical core, wrapped in an approachable interface for my tech-savvy but nontechnical friends wondering "How do I leverage all this AI stuff??"

So for the last two weeks I've been feverishly building [AgenC](https://github.com/mieubrisse/agenc).

It's progressed fine. I use it every day.

...and through the building process I've realized that Steve Yegge is a hell of a lot smarter, more prescient, and more experienced than I am.

If I had my eye on the horizon to catch waves, Yegge's been monitoring by satellite.

Gastown _is_ complex, but each part is there for a reason.

Which was right there in the announcement blog post, if I'd paid attention:

> Gas Town is complicated. Not because I wanted it to be, but because I had to keep adding components until it was a self-sustaining machine.

If you want coordinated agentic work, you need complexity.

Which also shouldn't be a surprise, because we have coordinated agentic work and it's called a company and they are complex.

"But wait," says my ego, "Steve's already built a way better AI _coding_ factory. But what about a _generic work_ factory? Maybe there's still hope for me to be a brilliant genius inventor."

So I explored hypothesized futures a little more, and realized the wave that's probably just about to arrive but hasn't yet is org-building tools for AI.

Enterprise-y things like permissioning, formal roles, a knowledge base, a work-tracking system, email... you need all those if you want an army of robot agents doing your every whim under you, because that's what CEOs need to coordinate their meat agents.

I think this is what [Yegge's hinting at with his Gas City teases](https://medium.com/@steve-yegge/steveys-birthday-blog-34f437139cb5).

### Now What?
My temptation now: "Build and launch NOW, before anyone else gets there!"

After all, a couple days is an eternity in this crazy modern world where you can get dozens of coding agents for a couple hundred bucks.

But... am I going to learn the lesson?

I keep trying to be the lone inventor, the one with the novel insight, keep eschewing the complexity and learnings of others.

I now think the lone inventor is dead. But why, precisely?

There's a theory that more population = more new ideas.

This makes sense given that [invention seems to be a random walk around the Adjacent Possible](https://www.ted.com/talks/stuart_kauffman_the_adjacent_possible_and_how_it_explains_human_innovation) (see also: [simultaneous independent invention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery)).

In other words: if you want to generate a truly novel idea, you must be fed a diet of thoughts at the fringe of human knowledge.

That foodstuff kind of lives on social media, but social media is a vast buffet of sugary fastfood with a few morsels of steak that lag the zeitgeist because it's frictionful to publish.

Really, nutritious goodness is found in the bubbling minds of curious people consuming ideas at the fringe.

But if you take your novel idea and then quickly secret it away to build, you'll fall behind. You need that stream of ideas. You need the community.

Therein lies the nettle for the ego: hiveminds are _powerful_.

### Hiveminds
The more people you have, the more Adjacent Possible you can traverse to stumble upon good ideas.

And if your community members are themselves driving teams of Claudes exploring idea-space... Cambrian explosion.

If your ego leads you to secret yourself away to try and be The Guy, you're too slow.

But if you give up being The Guy and merge with the hive, then you might actually have a novel idea.

No wonder [Yegge just described Anthropic as a hivemind](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-anthropic-hive-mind-d01f768f3d7b). (can you tell I think the guy's a prophet?)

Unsurprisingly...

- Anthropic launched Cowork just days after I started writing AgenC, filling the "How do I leverage AI?" gap for tech-savvy nontechnical people.
- Anthropic launched Claude `/insights` last week, filling some of the agent-training stuff I wanted AgenC to do.
- Anthropic launched agent teams last Thursday, filling part of the agent orchestration gap that both AgenC and Gastown are attempting to fill

### Ego Death
Where does all this leave me?

I won't lie, I'm working through some stuff.

My ego wants me to be this grand famous entrepreneur at the head of a successful company. My ego wants to be known for having Done It, been the one to build The Thing.

This desire led me to take my own path, over and over. Each time I end up too slow: building things that have already been done, thinking thoughts that have already been thought.

I'm realizing I must surrender to the hive.

Give up being The Guy. Share the idea freely. Focus on relationship-building over product-building. Publish the code open-source.

Especially in this modern world where each human is leveraged by dozens of Claudes (or more, when the agent orchestration finally gets solved)... 

It's the only way.
