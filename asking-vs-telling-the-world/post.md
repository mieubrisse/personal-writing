Bearing the weight of others' emotions












One Saturday a few months ago in SÃ£o Paulo, I was walking to a WeWork to do some journalling. I was stopped by a lady on a street corner who asked me something in plaintive Portuguese that I didn't catch. I apologized, said I didn't understand, and asked her to repeat it. She looked at me for a second, and then repeated anew: her son was sick, and could she please have some money?

I've always felt a guilt when interacting with the homeless. I grew up in a solidly middle-class family in an affluent suburb of Chicago, got a degree in Computer Science, worked for a Silicon Valley tech company starting in 2013, and left after the company IPO'd in 2020. Though my childhood house was small and old, and though I'd sometimes get my cousin's hand-me-downs, my parents never struggled to put food on the table and my physical comfort has only increased since I became a working adult.

When I first started travelling, I gave money to the homeless that I passed with little thought behind it. If I was walking with a girlfriend, I'd be more likely to give. If I was alone, I might or I might not. Regardless, I noticed that 

One Saturday a few months ago

I've been reflecting on genuineness and authenticity over the past couple months, and I've had a series of epiphanies leading me to the conclusion that I've lived my life shaping myself into the person that I think other people want me to be. I say "that I think" because I haven't necessarily _known_ what others have wanted from me; I've merely been constructing mental projections of what I _imagine_ others want and then trying to adapt myself into that model. Concretely, this looks like:

- In a conversation: "I'm worried that I'm making this person uncomfortable with too much eye contact while I'm speaking; I better look away"
- In a conversation with the female project manager of my apartment redesign, alone in my apartment: "I'm worried that she'll feel uncomfortable sexual tension so I'm going to be especially goofy and animated to show her that I have no romantic intentions so that she can feel comfortable"
- Meeting a new person: "I'm worried they're going to think I'm unfriendly or angry, so I better smile"
- Seeing a cute baby making faces at me: "I'm worried people are going to think I'm a creepy pedophile if I play with the kid so I better ignore him"
- When seeing a "Tip" line for the pizza that I'm carrying out: "I'm worried that they'll think I'm an asshole if I don't tip so I better tip"
- When suffering through a hot summer night in Florida: "I'm worried my family will be cold if I turn up the air conditioning so I better just sweat through it"

In all these cases, I'd fear that I'd be morally _bad_ so I'd modify my behaviour to avoid the perceived negative outcome. This all came to a head one Saturday in Brazil as I realized, "I'm tired of bearing the weight of others' emotions," for 

The pattern is as follows: I'll imagine a negative outcome, I'll fear the outcome, and I'll shrink away from it by molding my behaviour to avoid it. As I dug in one 






The problem is how hypothetical it all is: yes, the outcomes I fear are _possible_, but I've been assuming them as given despite never having received feedback that my eye contact is too strong, that I come across as creepy, that I'm an asshole, or that I'm unfriendly and unapproachable. In a phrase, I've been thinking _for_ others: assuming I know what's happening in their heads and how they perceive my behaviour, and then modifying myself so as to avoid my hypothetical negative outcomes. 



When giving feedback at Palantir, we tried to remind ourselves not to "cross the net" - not to assert things about what the other person is thinking or feeling (e.g. "You don't like me."). I'm now attempting to do the same in my personal life, 

The first step to  all came to a head one Saturday in Brazil when I complained to myself, "I'm tired of bearing the weight of other people's emotions."






<!--
In other contexts, in a more mild form, these behaviours could be fashioned as being considerate - thinking of others, as contrasted with being selfish. Consideration for others is indeed a useful tool in the prosocial toolbox, but problems arise when things go too far (as this clearly has): I've been very out-of-touch

andif I need to, I can be incredibly considerate. The problems arise  is how _fear-based_ these behaviours are: I'll imagine a possible negative outcome, fear the outcome, and then mold my behaviour to avoid it.

TODO fear!!!!

TODO exhausted bearing the weight of everyone else's emotions

TODO Thinking for the other person
