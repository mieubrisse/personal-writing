I was in the gym yesterday when [Body Head Bangerz' "Can't Be Touched"](https://youtu.be/VL_ab_ZGJPY?t=44) came on:

> I'm pimping my hoes</br>
> I'm jacking my foes</br>
> I spit at the police and duck my P.O.'s
> 
> I ain't going to court</br>
> You can call a judge</br>
> Tell him kiss my ass</br>
> 'Cause I ain't gonna budge</br>
> And I ain't going back to lock-up</br>
> You trying to lock a pop up</br>
> I ain't going back to broke</br>
> 
> And I'm never gonna stop the puffing</br>
> Not for nothing</br>
> The block they need me</br>
> The streets they need me</br>
> The club scene, nigga</br>
> Is mine believe me

"Wow," thinks I, "This individual is making some excellent life choices."

It's usually better for everyone not to examine gym music too closely. But in my defense, I was feeling kittenish while meandering my way back to reality from bench press-induced presyncope.

Let's examine our plucky protagonist's origin story, with `Rap-ese -> English` translation mode activated. He:

- Pimps women
- Is violent towards his enemies
- Has been to jail ("lock-up")
- Does marijuana ("puffing")

He also has some clearly-stated desires:

- Not to go back to jail again
- Not to be broke again

And given these stated desires, his chosen course of action is to:

- Spit at the police
- Dodge his parole officers ("P.O.s")
- Skip court appearances
- Recommend a judge to canoodle his posterior

Sage choices, my friend.

No! What! Who even thinks like this?

The reassuring answer: basically all us funny monkey-looking things.

It's a tempting trap. "My problems are the world's fault. My only issue is that I haven't given _enough middle finger_."

Yet, I've recently awakened to karma being real. 

Not because of Moral Accountant Buddha in the sky, tallying on one side every time I give money to a homeless person, and on the other side each time I treat my neighbors to a free performance of "My Heart Will Go On" in the shower.

But rather, as a physical property of the universe (though maybe Moral Accountant Buddha exists too).

Imagine if every time you come home you bring in flowers, or a beautiful piece of art. In a few weeks.. wow, so hygge. You'll feel good by virtue of surrounding yourself with nice things.

But now suppose you District 9'd your toilet, and every rumbling in your tummy had you projectile defecating straight on the floor. Yep, just right there... all over the carpet, and ottoman, and... was that your cat? "How weird," says you, "I'm slipping and covered in shit all the time."

Some shit, Sherlock.

Our actions in life have consequences. The energy we put out into the world gets absorbed by our surroundings and reflected back at us. We interact in the same places, with the same people, with the same cat that's now rolling all over the bed.

So if you want a more positive result, make a more positive choice. If you'd like not to go back to lock-up, you might want to reconsider telling the judge to kiss your ass.

Or at least say, "please".

Tedi notes:
- Small smile
- "Reads like a poem"
Point of confusion: 'hood without the ending apostrophe was confusing, wasn't sure what hygge
"My problems are the world's fault...."  -> Tedi thought that I was referencing the song
Liked, "basically all us funny monkey-looking things"
Liked the "Some shit, Sherlock" right after "I'm slipping and covered in shit all the time" (T: "this is poetic, funny")
"I know the District 9 reference, but I wonder how many of your audience know the reference"

"My favorite part is that it's a different writing style from your previous writings... more stream of conscious, witty"
Message is clear: not complicated
