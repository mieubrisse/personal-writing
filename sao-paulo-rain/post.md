title: "São Paulo Rain"

One plans around the rain in the Midwest where I was born. The Weatherman gambles such-and-such so bring an umbrella. Still grumble when it begins to patter earlier than anticipated. Automatic-sliding-glass doors slide automatically glass shut behind, hunch the shoulders, shuffle across the aromatic asphalt, fumble with the keys until the door clicks Safe Inside once more. Flip on the wipers, continue with the to-do list; perhaps a Starbucks for the cupholder as unfamiliar tires sizzle past on the stroad outside?

The rain is different in São Paulo where I was Born. Sometimes it creeps from the heavens, beading uncertainly on sweatshirts and hair, questions at the window, breathes languid drops down the windscreen. Other times, if one fails to pay attention to the rising breeze, it taps you on the head - Do you remember me? - and rouses to joy, inviting you to dance as the air washes slate-grey.

I can't be upset, for how could I be? He on the café stairs drapes her with an arm, pulling her close. A dog wriggles itself dry and I smile my sodden rue at the owner. A coat held aloft quests across the intersection, turns to divulge two grins behind wet-speckled glasses. And those mothers who cluster on the stoop, joined by circumstance, peep up at the clouds while the rain joyfully kisses back.
