title: "The 20 Minute Rule"
---
_Written on 2024-10-05_

After years of experimenting on myself, I've developed a framework for getting good at things that I call the "20 Minute Rule". It goes like this:

1. I must spend **at least** 20 minutes per day doing the thing I want to get good at.
2. If I do my 20 minutes, I get to feel good about myself. What I did doesn't matter, the quality of the practice doesn't matter. Only that I did my 20 minutes.
3. If I miss a day, I don't try to make it up. I just accept that I didn't put in my practice.

That's it: simple. But there's some very intentional psychology behind it.

Last month I saw [a Farnam Street post](TODO) saying, 

> You don't need more intensity; you need more consistency. Intensity impresses, consistency transforms.

This felt like a beautiful synthesis of what I'd long suspected: **time is the most important factor in skill development**.

Our culture today is all about flash & instant gratification. We get bombarded with news of cryptocurrency speculators who made millions in a month, Lamborghinis, beautiful houses, a cavalcade of insanely talented performances on Youtube or the Olympics, Wall Street, plastic surgery, world-class meals made in a half hour.

We want the results Right Now. 

But as any investor knows, time is your ally.

Let's say you want to double your money. The American stock market market averages ~6% annually. If you're willing to be patient, you can double your money in 12 years (because `1.06 ^ 12 = 2.01`) with little effort or risk. Just buy the S&P500 and wait.

But if you need to do so quickly, things get way complicated. The best financial firms in the world are doing 30-40% annual returns, and there are big questions about if that's sustainable indefinitely (during market crashes, on a 10+ year timespan, etc.). 

Meaning, if you want to double your money without going the insanely risky speculation route, the very fastest you could do so is a little over 2 years (because `1.4 ^ 2` is almost equal to 2). That also presupposes you get access to these elite funds; they don't give access to average Joe's like you and me.

So even if you're using the very best in the world (who, again, may not be long-term sustainable), **you still have to wait 2 years**.

The same goes for skill development. 

When I used to put all this pressure on myself to get very good at something very quickly, I was trying to dedicate several hours per week to it. For physical skills like running or martial arts, I'd get injured and my progress would get set back for months. For every skill, I'd eventually get fed up, start to dread practice, and quit.

But that pressure is ineffective and unnecessary. If I merely get 1% better per day and keep showing up every day, in a year's time I'll be at 365% of where I started (for the math nerds, I used linear rather than exponential scaling because I don't think skill development works like compound interest).

Getting 1% better in a practice session is very easy: my natural desires to experiment and challenge myself, plus the learning function of my mind, will handle that.

The most important factor is therefore that I keep showing up to practice. 

All of the 20 Minute Rule's stipulations are designed to take the pressure _off_, so that it's as easy to show up to practice as possible:

- Practice is only 20 minutes, because once it's 30 minutes then it feels like a Whole Thing to schedule but 20-minute blocks can be found in a lot of places.
- What I do in practice doesn't matter, because once I feel like I have to grind through a specific routine practice starts to feel more like work and I dread showing up.
- If I miss a day, I don't obligate myself to make it up so that the next practice doesn't feel heavy.
- I'm not obligated to do any more than 20 minutes, which is pressure relief on those days (which always come) where I don't feel like practicing. I tell myself, "It's only 20 minutes."

**Interesting bit of psychology #1:** I've found resistance to practice to be front-loaded. On the days when I don't feel excited to practice, I'll start with the intent of just grinding out my 20 minutes. Once I get 10-15 minutes in though, I start to find my groove. When the 20 minutes hits, there's a ~70% chance I won't want to stop.

This is why practice is _at least_ 20 minutes: you want to give yourself the option, but not the obligation, to capture those extra moments beyond 20 minutes.

The other 30% of the time, I feel "thank God practice is over". That's okay too; I put in my 20 minutes and that means I get to mark it as a win.

**Interesting bit of psychology #2:** The more I consistently practice, the more excited I find myself to be for practicing. I suspect this has to do with innate human resistance to the unknown

In Malcolm Gladwell's "Outliers", he finds that becoming world class at any skill takes roughly 10,000 hours of practice. Most people picking up a skill aren't trying to be world-class - they want to do the thing, enjoy it, and get reasonably good at it - so let's say that 50% of world class would be Very Impressive in the everyday world. Even being half as good as Lebron James or Tiger Woods or Gordon Ramsay (which costs 5,000 hours) is plenty.

So if you've never done a skill before, 

So let's say you're just starting to learn, and 
Let's say you're at a 0-out-of-10 good at your desired skill. If you want to get to a 1 (10% of elite level), you have to put in 1,000 hours.

If you pressure yourself to do this over the course of a year, you better be 



Let's say you're at a 1 out of 10 on whatever skill you're trying to get good at. If you want to get to a 4,
