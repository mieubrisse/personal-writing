Life is not hurdles

I used to think life was like running hurdles.

Life presents you with a challenge...

...and then you're good.

In reality, life is a spiral.

You get presented with a challenge...

But each time it gets easier.

You grow, the bump smooths, and eventually you don't even notice it:
