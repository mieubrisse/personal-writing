Back in old days, e.g. Revolutionary War, you had to have an estate
- George Washington, Thomas Jefferson: they had land, slaves, etc.
- This produced for them
- They were aping the English country lords

Now, you can have an estate that produces for you without needing any humans
- Content empire: my blog posts
- My Github repo empire

I have physical things that produce
- People come to my tools, my posts, and they get value out of them
- I get something in return: a following, influence, money

Having these permanent assets mean that any of them can explode: 
- Obama had his book which was out-of-print, but it shot to the top of the bestseller after he won the Senate

With AI, this becomes even easier
- E.g. my categorizing book notes AI, that helps me manage my estate

This is the new digital empire: you don't need to have any 

This is massive leverage!!!! My will gets directly translated into reality

Skills you need:
- Technical skills: you need to understand how to create, maintain, and debug automation
- Communication skills: you need to be able to understand how to tell AI and other humans what you want, clearly
