The Relationship Compass
=========================
Finding & following your north when relationship conflict arises

![](./images/image.png)

Last week my girlfriend and I had our first fight.

You know how in a fight, you want to ensure you're being a reasonable human while also being firm on the things that are important to you?

It feels like playing a piano concert in the middle of a boxing match: a million delicate decisions made at maximum velocity.

"Should I respond? If so, what do I say? Am I being a dick? Am I being too soft?"

Today I want to share two tools I use to help find my north when confusion reigns.

### I'm okay, you're okay
The first comes from a branch of psychology called Transactional Analysis (specifically, [this book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_OK_%E2%80%93_You%27re_OK)). It goes:

"I'm okay, you're okay"

It is a diagnostics test.

Here's the idea: when someone is okay, they're good with things as they are.

They don't need to change the outside world. They don't need to change another person.

Believing "I'm okay, you're okay" means you can meet the world where it is (which is [really effective](https://altered.substack.com/p/charisma)).

If you believe "I'm okay, you're okay", you're not needy. You don't need to make any drastic or urgent changes.

There are other attitudes:

- "I'm not okay, you're okay" - Depression, self-loathing, victimhood
- "I'm okay, you're not okay" - Blaming, judgment, arrogance
- "I'm not okay, you're not okay" - Chaos

Since each of these has a "not okay", they necessitate drastic, urgent changes.

Under that axiom, it's _natural_ that stress, fear, and reactivity arise!

But stressed, scared humans escalate conflicts instead of resolving them.

So the next time you're in an argument, check in with yourself about how you feel.

Do you _need_ to change your partner, or the world? Do you _need_ to change yourself?

If so, it's a good sign that something's not okay.

To come back to center, first identify what you need: "Why don't I feel 'I'm okay, you're okay'? What do I need from the other person or reality?"

For me, the things that come up are often like "an apology", "recognition", or "soothing my fears".

I then ask, "Do I really _need_ these things from the other person? Or should I be giving them to myself?"

Frequently, the things that feel _so_ urgent to get from the other person... are really because I'm feeling weak and vulnerable because I'm tired, stressed, or low-energy.

As the quote goes, "Fatigue makes cowards of us all."

What I really need is not to force the other person or the world to conform, but to relax, eat, and sleep.

It's staggering the amount of times I've disengaged from an argument that felt SO important, slept on it, and came back the next morning only to find that it wasn't a big deal after all.

The Fair Fighting Rule
----------------------
In the fight with my girlfriend last week, I had unknowingly slipped into "I'm not okay, you're not okay".

I felt vulnerable and scared, wanted reassurance, and was pressuring her hard to recognize a perceived slip-up on her part.

Thankfully, I eventually caught that I wasn't feeling okay and slowed the conversation down.

I slept on it, and the next morning realized I had to get us back to "I'm okay, you're okay".

[The best negotiation course I've ever taken](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Negotiating-Best-Deal/dp/1629970654) teaches that people yell in arguments because they feel they're not being heard.

To fix, the course introduces the "fair fighting rule". It goes like this:

In an argument, one person speaks and the other listens. When the speaker is done, the listener must summarize their understanding of what the speaker has said to the speaker's satisfaction before the listener responds. The listener is _not_ saying they agree; simply that they understood. The roles then swap as many times as necessary.

I asked if my girlfriend was open to trying it, she agreed, and...

the conversation de-escalated, we found our common ground, reconnected, and got to a great place with a little more understanding of each other.

This is because the fair fighting rule is **magic**.

I've used it for the past 4 years, and so long as both parties abide by the rules it _will_ deescalate the conflict.
