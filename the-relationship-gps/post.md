The Relationship GPS
=====================
Finding your north when relationship conflict arises

![](./images/image.png)

Yesterday my girlfriend and I had our first fight.

You know how in a fight, you want to ensure you're doing your part to be a reasonable human while also being firm on the things that are important to you?

It feels like trying to play a piano concert in the middle of a boxing match: a million delicate decisions made at maximum velocity.

Should I respond? If so, what do I say? Am I being a dick? Am I being too soft?

Today I want to introduce a tool to help you find north when this confusion reigns.

It comes from a branch of psychology called transactional analysis, and it goes:

"I'm okay, you're okay"

Here's the idea: when someone is okay, they're good as they are.

They don't need to change, and they don't need to change the world or another person.

Saying "I'm okay, you're okay" means you can meet the world where it is, [which is way more effective](https://altered.substack.com/p/charisma).

By contrast, there are other attitudes:

- "I'm not okay, you're okay" - Depression, self-loathing, victimhood
- "I'm okay, you're not okay" - Blaming, judgment, arrogance
- "I'm not okay, you're not okay" - Chaos

The next time you're in that argument, consider the attitude you're adopting.

If you're trying to force your conversational partner to do something, you might be adopting "You're not okay".

If you're highlighting ways you've been wronged, you might be adopting "I'm not okay".

If you're feeling hurt and attacking in response, you might be adopting "I'm not okay, you're not okay."

To come back to center, ask yourself, "What do I feel I need that's compelling me to take action?"

Frequently, something like "recognition" or "an apology" will pop up.

Then you can ask, "Is this really what I need?" either give yourself what you need (e.g. space, rest), or let it go because it's actually not a real need.

This was useful in the fight with my girlfriend.

For the actual fight yesterday, I had unknowingly slipped into "I'm okay, you're not okay" and was pressuring her pretty hard.

This morning, when I realized what I was doing, I knew I needed to get us back to "I'm okay, you're okay".
