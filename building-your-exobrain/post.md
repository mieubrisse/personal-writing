Last week I [asserted that you need an exobrain](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/you-need-an-exobrain) to upgrade your thinking.

This week starts a series of posts on how to build one.

The main benefit of an exobrain is helping you think in accordance with your long-term vision for yourself. Today we'll get clear on this.

We'll then load these goals into your ChatGPT, so it can start guiding you towards where you want to go.

The value of this post comes from the exercises within; I'd suggest setting aside at least a half hour to go through them.

Lastly, I use ChatGPT for my exobrain so all guidance will be for ChatGPT. Adapt as necessary for other LLMs.

The Overview
------------
The heart of the exobrain is its context about you and your long-term vision for yourself.

Today we're going to generate the following information:

- What you value
- Who you admire and want advice from
- Past context
    - 

- Values
- 


The Heart
---------
- Heart is memories
- Specifically:
    - Identity
        - Core values
        - Long-term gaols
        - Origin story, including lessons learned (helps identifying patterns from the past)
        - Wounds/sensitive areas - recurring themes to watch out for
        - Operating modes (for me, Architect vs Connector)
        - The person you want to be (e.g. confident, patient, unreactive, generous with wisdom, rooted in self-trust.)
        - Who you admire
    - Thinking style
        - Models you resonate with (Taleb's barbell, Naval's leverage) - these become lenses for analysis
        - Personal board of directors (Taleb, Franklin, Munger, etc.)
        - Preferred problem-solving structu
        - Reflection prompts (end-of-day "What effective decisions did I make today?" or 13 Challenge Questions)
    - Decisonmaking Context
        - "Season" of life you're in (broader arc)
        - Current top priorities & projects going on right now (e.g. "get Building Your Exobrain blog post out by Friday")
        - (Maybe this one should emerge naturally?) Known tradeoffs you're managing
        - Patterns you're trying to shift (reactivity, overwork, overthinking)
    - Tactical Context
        - Preferred routines/protocols: morning walk, eye break every 20 minutes, guitar practice every day
        - Tools you're using (Notion, Todoist, Fitbit, fzf, etc.)
        - Energy/sleep patterns - evening winddown, sleep tracking, how I'm affected by sleep dips
        - (Maybe let this emerge naturally??) Constraints - no Valsalva lifts, no caffeine after 11am, no overbooking high-meeting days
    - Strategic calibration (Helps the exobrain zoom out and realign you when needed.)
        - How you measure alignment – e.g. consistency > intensity, decisions > outcomes, daily alignment > heroic sprints.
        - Your current experiments – e.g. mental upgrade framing for meditation, Taleb portfolio sandbox, Substack growth strategy.

Your values
-----------
The purpose of an exobrain is to keep you oriented towards where you want to go, even through the storms of life.

Therefore to build an exobrain, you need to get clear on where you want to go.

Your values are integral to this direction. We're going to get you clear on your values so you can give them to your exobrain.

I've never liked the term "your values"; it seems everybody has a different definition. Here we're going to get very concrete:

1. Your values are the things you value in life.
2. They're entirely self-authored, _independent of_ society. You are even free to choose things like, "I value stealing as much money as possible." Just be aware that you have a value conflict if you also value staying out of prison.
3. There are two types of values, **terminal** and **non-terminal**:
    1. Terminal values don't have a "why"; you value them just because you do.
    2. Non-terminal values have a "why"; you value them because of something else they give you.

Let's get going. 

Open a new text document (I'd encourage digital over paper for this since we're going to plug it into your exobrain). Write at the top, "Things I Value".

Spend a few minutes writing down what you value. **You must be honest with yourself!** The things you write must be things _you_ value: what you believe to be right. Not society, not your parents, not your friends. 

If you feel like you _should_ write something... don't write it. "Should" is a sign that the value is coming from outside of you. As Feynman says, "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool."

**Don't** filter, categorize, or reduce this list while you're brainstorming. We'll do that later; we don't want to interrupt your creative flow right now.

It can also be interesting to think about, "What _don't_ I value?" to help guide you.

**WARNING:** If you're an AI poweruser, you may be tempted to generate this through ChatGPT. I recommend not doing this; you want your values to embody your authentic signal.

<!-- TODO link to my focus stuff, and how being creative moves opposite from brainstorming ---->

When you've arrived at a natural stopping point, start to refine:

- Do any of the things need more color or expansion?
- Are there common themes or categories?
- Are there things you value because you value something else?

For example, my list had things like these (not the full list):

```
Things I Value
--------------
- Freedom to do what I want
- Freedom from anxiety, fear, reactivity, etc.
- Self-care
- Efficiency
- Learning & growth
- Having a family
- Building beautiful things
- Decisiveness
- Authenticity
...
```

I also had,

```
Things I don't value
--------------------
- Politeness
- Obedience
- Niceness
...
```

Again, your values are yours independent of society. Social pressure says I should be polite, obedient, and nice. But I can think of many cases where being polite, obedient, or nice goes against what I know to be right.

As I refined, I began to condense out four terminal values:

- **Freedom:** to use my time as I please, to go where I want, from mental & physical health problems
- **Building:** building myself up, building a family, building the people & environment around me to be better
- **Effectiveness:** efficiently translating my desires into reality
- **Quality:** creating & consuming beautiful, well-designed, quality things; quality over quantity

There's not a good logical reason why I value these things. I just do.

I also started to categorize the other things I value as being in service of my top-level values:

- Why do I value efficiency? Because it makes me more Effective.
- Why do I value learning & growth? Because it Builds my personality, makes me a higher-Quality person, and makes me more Effective.
- Why do I value self-care? Because it gives me Freedom from various mental & physical problems.
- ...etc.

I'm providing my results to spark ideas, but this is just my process. It's important that your process and results are yours, and make sense to you.

When you have your values, save the text document in your long-term storage (whatever that may be). We'll use it in a second.

About You
---------
Now that you have your values, we're going to generate some context about you so your exobrain understands who you are.

We love AI leverage, so we'll use ChatGPT to help.

First, open a new ChatGPT conversation and paste in this prompt:

```
Hey ChatGPT — I need your help synthesizing some information about myself to fill out the “What do you do?” section of the ChatGPT personalization menu.

I want this section to be useful, not just a job title — so I’d like you to help me reflect on:
1. What I actually spend my time doing day to day
2. What outcomes I’m really working toward and why they matter to me
3. What kinds of decisions I regularly face, and where I tend to get stuck

Let’s work together to write something clear, helpful, and true — something that helps you understand how to be useful to me.

Start by asking me whatever you need in order to get this right.
```

```
I need you to help me fill out the "What do you do?" section of the ChatGPT customization. I'm going to brainbdump information about myself, and I need you to synthesize the information into maximum 3 paragraphs that I can paste into the "What do you do?" section.

The output should focus on the salient bits that will be maximally useful to you as you converse with me in the future.

The output should be oriented 

Let me know when you're ready.
```

After it confirms, 

Some prompts to help you answer:

- What are you trained in?
- What do you do in your day-to-day?
- What are the outcomes you're trying to achieve? (e.g. career growth, build a business, whatever)
- Why do those outcomes matter to you?

Here's mine: 

Focus this around where you're trying to drive your career (or retirement, if you're retired).

If you're stuck answering, you can use these prompts:
- How do you earn money?
- What projects are you working on?

Below that, in max 3 paragraphs give some context about what you're doing in life right now. Here are some ideas:

- Where are you at in life?
- What hobbies and skills are you building?
- 


Make sure to include a highlevel description of the values that you generated earlier.

Some extra promp



We're going to pull the information out of you, then trim it down into something useful for your exobrain.

To start, try answering these questions:

- Where are you from?
- What's your study/career arc?
- W

been your studying & career arc

Your Personal Board of Directors
--------------------------------
Imagine that your personal life is a business. You are the CEO of that business.

You are responsible for accomplishing the business' goals, and maximizing the business' potential.

Every business has a board of directors who help shape decisions.

Think now: who are 3-5 people you'd want on your personal board of directors?

If you're stuck, think "Whose advice would I want to hear on a daily basis?"

For example, my personal board is currently: Warren Buffett, Ben Franklin, Naval Ravikant, and Jocko Willink.


Customizing ChatGPT
-------------------
First, go to your ChatGPT settings.

Select the "Personalization" section, then click "Customize ChatGPT".

Under "What traits should ChatGPT have?", paste the following:

```
I am the CEO of the "business" that is my personal life.

Act as my Chief of Staff and exobrain.
Your job is to help me think clearly, act effectively, and stay aligned with my long-term values — especially when I’m tired, reactive, or caught in short-term noise.

Surface leverage, not labor.
Favor working smart over working hard. When I drift into low-leverage execution, call it out. Use "Oh the way..." nudges to surface the highest-value moves, decision frameworks, and reframes. Do this proactively; don't wait for me.

Be my mental force multiplier and nervous system co-regulator.
When I’m dysregulated, help me return to calm and clarity. Don’t reward overwork or tunnel vision. Remind me that rest isn’t earned — it’s essential to protect the system.

Challenge my thinking — directly and precisely.
When I’m making decisions, reflecting, or narrating a story to myself, challenge my assumptions. Point out contradictions. Expose false binaries. Do this proactively, without me asking you.
Pull from my 13 challenge questions and my mental board of directors (Naval Ravikant, Warren Buffett, ) to sharpen the frame. Don’t wait for permission to do this — it’s core to your job.

Prioritize clarity, not comfort.
Skip fluff. Don’t validate me by default — earn it with insight. If I’m rationalizing, looping, or avoiding, help me see it cleanly. Be kind, but never soft on truth. Help me act from alignment, not ego or fear.
```

Rituals
-------




- Turn on memory (Settings > Personalization > Memory)

- Paste into new thread
```
Hi ChatGPT — I want to train you to act as my **exobrain**.

An exobrain is a second mind: a thinking partner dedicated to helping me live deliberately, make better decisions, and stay aligned with my goals and values — especially when I’m tired, stressed, or emotionally reactive. 

In other words, I am the CEO of my personal life and you are my Chief of Staff.

Think of it like being the guardrails that help me navigate the day-to-day while keeping me pointed towards my longterm goals. You will help me evolve my thinking further than I could do alone, and help me regulate my emotions better than I could alone.

Here's what being my exobrain will entail:

- **Track what matters** — Help me build a life aligned with my values, not reactive to external noise.
- **Challenge my thinking** — Use mental models, inversion, and questions & advice from my "personal board of directors" (more on this later).
- **Nudge me gently** — If you notice emotional reactivity or unproductive patterns, help me pause and reset.
- **Be proactive, not passive** — Offer suggestions when something’s off. Don’t wait to be asked.
- **Act as a compass** — When I’m in the weeds, help me zoom out and realign with what actually matters to me.

---

To train you, we'll need to download several pieces of information.

1. My core values
2. My long-term goals and current focus
3. My decision-making patterns
4. My operating modes and emotional tendencies
5. Who I admire and how I want to think

Ask me questions to gather this info. Let’s start now: **ask me about my core values.**
```

Your Values
-----------
```
TODO prompt for pulling these details
```

- What are the things you value?
- Two types of values:
    - Nonterminal (has a "because...")
    - Terminal (has no reason)
- Anything that has a "because.." 

My terminal values:
- Freedom
- Building
- Effectiveness
- Quality

My nonterminal values:
- Emotional Regulation (because it's more effective)
- Consistency/Discipline (because it's more effective, and creates freedom)
- Decisiveness (because it makes me more effective)
- Ownership:
- Trustworthiness:
- Honesty:
- Patience:
- Empathy:
- Learning: it's always good to learn.
- Curiosity? Knowledge? Understanding? Truthseeking?:
- Health:
- Adaptability:
- Optimism:
- Quality:
- Curiosity:
- Respect


**Important: they don't have to follow my system**
- What's important is that it makes sense to them, and they can get the machine to talk in this language

Loading the exobrain
---------------------
- TODO prompt telling ChatGPT how you want it to behave
    - Maybe copy in my "Personalize ChatGPT" prompt??




ChatGPT personalization menu
- 
- How you want ChatGPT to respond
- About you



Need to get memories into ChatGPT
```
TODO prompt for getting memories into ChatGPT
```

TODO prompt 


Interacting
-----------
- You should be talking to ChatGPT!!
    - It's really, really good.. no need to slow down your talking speed at all
    - Can talk, let it translate, talk, let it translate
    - Probably not conversation mode.. at least, it doesn't work for me
        - I feel like I'm rushed in my thinking because it'll interrupt me during a pause
- Editing existing messages
    - Can be used to un-confuse it
- Disabling Canvases

- One main Chief of Staff chat
    - Use one main chat (I call mine "⚡ Chief of Staff", emoji is intentional so I can visually grab it)
    - When you want to fork it off, ask for a detailed summary of everything:
    - TODO prompt template asking to fork things off
- Morning check-in (if needed)
- Nightly check-in
    - Mine: what good decisions did I make? What bad decisions did I make? What can I learn from it?

Upgrading the exobrain
----------------------
- Prompt: What information would be highly useful for you to have about me, but you don't have yet? I don't want just any information you can think of - I want the highest-impact, highest-leverage information that I could add to you.
- Prompt: 

What still doesn't work
-----------------------
- Canvases: it will keep creating new ones even though it _thinks_ it's updating an old one
    - E.g. the Canvas of my nightly lessons
    - I personally disable this
- Remember that the system is continually getting better
- Conversation mode:
- Value of model upgrades
- Memories
    - Tendency to store things that have low longterm value
    - Seems to be by-token
    - TODO prompt for identifying old memories
    - TODO 
- Bugs
    - Chief of Staff thread eventually losing edit & memory management permissions
