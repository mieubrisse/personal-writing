subtitle: "An expansion on judgement"

- Navalmanack got me thinking hard about how decisionmaking/judgement is _the_ thing (since leverage multiplies it hard)
- Autobiography of Ben Franklin only amplified this:
    - Ben Franklin's dad was known for good judgement, so people would come to him with problems
    - Ben Franklin took pains to live virtuously and keep his reputation clean; as a result, people wanted to do deals with him
    - Later in life, Ben Franklin became like his dad: known for wise council, so people would come to him asking for problems
        - This, too, helped connect him to powerful people
        - It also brought him even more business deals
- Becoming CEO of my own life
    - Responsible for making good decisions
- The domain is now probabilistic
    - Michael Mauboussin: "A CEO doesn't _know_ he's making the right strategy; it's all probabilistic"
- Automating my life, and delegating
- I should pursue (and say) what I think is right
    - Anything less is suboptimal: doing something you _don't_ think is the best way to do things because of fear
    - Many people do this because they're afraid of the consequences
        - E.g. being visibly and publicly wrong, or people (maybe even their partner) getting upset at them
    - If you hide what you think, or sugarcoat it, then you're delaying feedback on it (and operating more time with a potentially-wrong belief)
        - Put it out there! Let it be proved wrong! Own it if you're wrong!
    - If you say something that people disagree with, then own the consequences! You couldn't do anything else besides that _anyways_; it's what you actually believe!
        - What would be the alternative - you pretend to believe something else, and just hope they don't find out about your real belief?
        - You have your beliefs for a _reason_: the data you've seen makes you believe that's the right way. So long as you update your beliefs when you get more data, who cares if you're wrong or offensive?
    - If you put 

- Getting out of your own way
    - certain anxious or controlling behaviours at Kurtosis
    - alcohol, and the bad decisions when on alcohol
    - caffeine -> lack of sleep -> lack of emotional regulation (which leads to reaching for more caffeine, Netflix, alcohol, etc.)
    - giving friends unasked-for relationship advice
