As an adult I'm waking up to:

1. The power of having a broad group of interesting people in my life (most recently, seeing how [Ben Franklin's wide network was a huge advantage for his life](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/building-ben-franklin)).
2. How bringing positivity and growth to the world is important to me.

So, inspired by [two other](https://untested.sonnet.io/notes/say-hi/) [interesting people](https://eatonphil.com/chat.html), I'm providing [a public link where you can book time with me](https://book.vimcal.com/p/kevintoday/chat-with-me). Whatever you may need is fair game; the topics I'm most experienced with are below.

In exchange I'd ask you to make a $100 donation to [Doctors Without Borders](https://give.doctorswithoutborders.org/campaign/699382/donate?) ([96% Charity Navigator score](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/133433452)) (though if you're in a hard financial situation right now and can't afford it, you can still book - just pay it forward to someone else when you can).

Topics I've done full-time for work:

- Coding/software engineering
- Data integrations (7 years at Palantir)
- Systems architecture
- Leading teams of engineers as a tech lead & CTO
- Founding [a devtools startup](https://www.kurtosis.com/)
- Building [a devtools product](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis)

Topics I'm passionate about, but haven't done for work:

- [Personal efficiency & organizational systems](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/the-leverage-series)
- [Mental health, therapy, and emotional management](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/anxiety-emotions-and-freedom)
- Personal financial planning
- Helping others achieve their goals (coaching?)
- [Male/female dating & relationships](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/what-seduction-means-to-me)
- Weightlifting science
- Rock climbing
- Music (specifically guitar, singing, and drums)
- Board games
