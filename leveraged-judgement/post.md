title: "Leveraged Judgement"
---

I am listening to the excellent [Almanack Of Naval Ravikant](https://www.navalmanack.com/). Naval believes that modern society and technology permit insane leverage. I.e., small choices can get amplified manyfold to result in outsize consequences. It's not a hard argument to buy - nearly every viral video was a small chunk of work that triggered widespread consequences.

But just because a small amount of work _can_ trigger widespread results doesn't guarantee it will. The startup world is strewn with the bones of failed companies. The music industry is full of never-famous nobodies.

In such a leveraged world, Naval says, good judgment is key. If you are demonstrably right 10% more than your top competitor, I can load you up with capital (leverage you) and we'll make hundreds of millions.

This is why Rick Rubin is such a big deal in the music industry: his judgment seems to consistently produce hits. Indeed, Rubin himself considers his taste to be what makes him special.

If Naval's assertion is true, then making good decisions is a huge component of being successful. Therefore, anyone who wants to be successful should study good decisionmaking.

Fortunately, we're spoiled for educational resources on decisionmaking. Some of my personal favorites:

1. Shane Parrish's [Farnam Street newsletter](https://fs.blog/) is dedicated to figuring out how to make better decisions. Unsurprisingly, it's been a hit with Wall Street traders. My "consistency over intensity" mantra came from here.
1. Nassim Taleb's books like "Fooled By Randomness", "The Black Swan", and "Antifragile" teach us how to deal with randomness, and the limits of what we can predict. Much of my worldview (and financial success) has been formed by Taleb's theory.
1. The [Rationality movement](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalist-movement) (commonly associated with [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/), Eliezer Yudkowsky, and Scott Alexander's blogs ([1](https://slatestarcodex.com/), [2](https://www.astralcodexten.com/))) are focused (among other things) on how to identify what it's true, which is the basis for accurate decisionmaking. Concepts from Yudkowsky's "From AI To Zombies" are now a foundational part of my view of reality.
1. Michael Singer's "The Untethered Soul", "The Surrender Experiment", and "Living Untethered" speak principally to our internally-experienced self, and how thoughts and emotions cloud our perception of reality. I've found these books to be transformative for dealing with the emotional side of clear decisionmaking.
1. I did executive coaching with [Ravi Raman](https://raviraman.com/) for some years, and one of his core principles is to get grounded before you make any decisions. I use this every single day now, as I've realized how quieting the noise can clear up judgment for making that one great decision which has outsized impact.

I consumed all the above resources before I started the "The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant". Yet only now, with Naval's thoughts on leverage, am I realizing that I need to revisit them because _they're even more powerful than I realized_. 

I used to think of these resources' philosophies as things to consider in your life as you go about your daily work. Now, I'm realizing they might be THE work: if you get the concepts of good decisionmaking down and leverage correctly, you can remove the necessity for hundreds of hours of labor.

To see this in practice, some examples:

- A single smart financial bet can create levels of wealth where you never need to work again (this is a very Nassim Taleb idea)
- Conversely, avoiding one bad financial decision can be the difference between going bankrupt and staying solvent (again, a Taleb idea)
- Understanding _the importance of making financial bets at all_ (rather than keeping your money in a savings account) can be the difference between wealth and a lifetime of work
- Good investment deals commonly need to be acted on in a very short timeframe, and understanding the nature of risk-taking (when should you move fast vs slow?) allows you to capture value from good deals safely
- Internalizing the lessons of this post (the importance of leverage & decisionmaking, conveyed from Naval Ravikant) will itself upgrade your decisionmaking by triggering you to seek out still-better decisionmaking and leveraged opportunities
- If you understand leverage and hire someone to do your laundry, even if you only do 1 hour of laundry per week, you save 3,120 hours (130 days, or 4.3 months) over 60 years of adult life
- Understanding the importance of automation (basically computers, including ChatGPT) is the difference between hundreds of hours doing tasks manually vs automating it

If these are ideas are cogent to you, some considerations you might apply to your own life:

- Are you looking for the way to work smart, not hard? I.e., are you looking for the small action that will make all the difference?
- Where are areas in your life that are currently TODO TODO
- Are you investing in upgrading your decisionmaking (e.g., using the resources above)?
