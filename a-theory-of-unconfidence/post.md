title: "A Theory Of Masculine Unconfidence"

_Written on 2024-09-16 & 2024-09-24_

I've recently been speaking to men who struggle with lack of confidence. I empathize with them, as I've wrestled with confidence issues for much of my life. I won't claim to have "solved" confidence, as I think it's a spectrum that one gets better at. But I do feel I've worked on the issue for long enough, and made enough personal headway, that I have something to contribute: a theory for what causes unconfidence, and how to fix it.

From here on, I'm going to address you, the reader, under the assumption that you're a man wrestling with unconfidence. Please remember that this is just my theorizing, offered in the hopes that it might be useful to you; I am not a therapist and this isn't a substitute for therapy (which I highly recommend).

### What is confidence?
First, what exactly _is_ confidence? 

For a guy wrestling with unconfidence, I know that confidence can seem like a magical gift bestowed on others...  but not you. Confident men seem to have superhuman powers: apparent fearlessness, decisiveness, a decidedness of purpose, and the ability to make a decision without worrying over it. "Why," you might wonder, "Was I denied the gift?"

My assertion: confidence is one's belief that whatever happens will be okay.

A confident man can't see the future any more than an unconfident man. Rather, the confident man moves decisively because he has experience thriving through life's turbulence. The unconfident man, by contrast, feels that volatility and the unknown are scary. He feels compelled to be careful.

To the confident man, the unconfident man's caution seems completely unreasonable. Yet, **the unconfident man is not crazy: he feels this way for a reason**. 

I've yet to meet a man struggling with unconfidence who didn't have a past where he was punished for being bold. Perhaps he felt frequently criticized, or discouraged from trying, or his family was perpetually negative, or he didn't feel he had a safe and restoring place to return to when life beat him up. 

The man spent 18+ years in this environment, vulnerable to the whims of his caretakers. Within this context, unconfidence is a sensible survival strategy to avoid drawing attention so the man can preserve precious emotional energy & well-being.

The man is no longer vulnerable, but the survival strategy he developed persists. Now, it's damaging his life. He feels trapped, unable to take risks to pursue the opportunities he wants.

### Positivity Journalling
Fortunately, that survival strategy which is no longer useful can be replaced with one that serves the man better. Like anything, this is simply a matter of practice.

But what should the man practice? 

He should practice focusing on the positive in any circumstance.

It's important to understand that the environment of the unconfident man's formative years instilled a watchfulness in him. Because he didn't feel psychologically safe, he learned that he had to be on the lookout for danger else bad things would happen. He now focuses mostly on identifying and avoiding negatives. 

This negative focus sets him up for constant stress. If the negative things he's worried about don't happen, he simply feels neutral (not "good", because there are always more negatives to watch out for). If they do happen, he feels like his fears have come to pass _and_ that his worrying was justified.

When the only two outcomes are feeling neutral-but-watchful and feeling bad, the man understandably feels pessimistic about the future. He feels a sense of scarcity, lack, and loss. Within this frame of reference, worrying and anxiety make sense.

To break the cycle, the man needs to start directing his focus to the positive aspects of a situation that he's not currently giving attention to. Repeated practice will train his mind to recognize that he's also making forward progress, not just staying neutral or going backwards. With time, his mind will start to learn that it can let go of control because any situation can be turned to his advantage with the right mindset.

I call this Positivity Journalling: 




confidence is a skill. With practice, the unconfident man can become confident by reshaping his view of himself and his relation to the world. 

To do so, you must first understand that the lack of psychological safety in the environment of your younger years primed you to be alert for danger. You're

recognizing that **unconfidence is the result of continually focusing on the and confidence are the results of a persistent focus on the negative and positive, respectively**.

This is why unconfidence is so hard to change. The unconfident man's default, well-practiced instinct is to focus on the negative. Even when he does push himself to take a risk, his mind obsesses over any failures and his subconscious internalizes the experiences as net negative. In the future, he'll believe that it's better not to try. This is a _rational behaviour_, given his past environment!

But, this man's default is not serving him. To upgrade his mindset to a more confident one freeing him to take the risks he wants, he needs to stop focusing on the negative and focus on the positive instead.

_This will feel bad to the man!_

For reasons that aren't yet clear to me, unconfident men often seem to derive a bitter comfort from focusing on the negative. They know that they're not getting what they long-term want. Yet, focusing on the negative might justify their inaction in the short term (which, again, makes sense when emotional energy was in short supply).

A tactic I've found useful in helping friends is repeatedly and relentlessly forcing them to exercise their positivity muscle at the expense of their negativity muscle. I do this through Positivity Journalling, where I ask them to list out _only_ the things that are going well for them. This could be in the scope of his life, if he's feeling generally down, or it could be about an explicit event.

The cool bit is there's _always_ something he can list. Even if everything went terribly, he still learned something and he's still showing up for Positivity Journalling. Often, the man realizes there's much more positive than he realized.

In my experience, consistently doing this exercise steadily increases a man's belief in himself. As he emphasizes the positive and deemphasizes the negative, he starts to mute the avalanche of negative thinking when he doesn't succeed. His tolerance for risk-taking increases.

### On neediness & reactivity
I'd also like to comment on neediness and reactivity, as I believe they come hand-in-hand with unconfidence.

When a man is focusing on the negative, he needs reality to match his expectations. Anything less becomes fodder for a negative spiral in his mind. When reality matches his expectations, he feels uneasily okay. Yet, he can't relax because he feels he needs to spring into drastic, urgent action should things start to deviate from what he expects.

This man is _needy_ of reality, and he is _reactive_ to reality deviating from his expectations. His relationships might suffer because he appears anxious and stressed. He might be constantly trying to control reality (and inevitably losing).

When I'm feeling the need to control or take urgent action, I've found it useful to ask, "What do I feel I need right now?" I always find something lurking underneath, and I

### Conclusion
When a man switches to focusing on the positive, he is able to extract good from whatever result occurs. His life becomes a series of win-win's. Not because the chances of his preferred outcome are any higher, but because 

Rather than investing energy trying to tame uncontrollable reality, he uses his energy
