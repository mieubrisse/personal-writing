title: "A Theory Of Masculine Unconfidence"
---
_Written on 2024-09-16 & 2024-09-24_

I've recently been speaking to men who struggle with lack of confidence. I've wrestled with confidence issues for much of my life, so I empathize. I won't claim to have "solved" confidence, as I think it's a spectrum that one gets better at. But I do believe I've worked on the issue for long enough, and made enough personal headway, that I have something to contribute: a theory for what causes unconfidence, and a potential solution.

From here on, I'm going to address you, the reader, under the assumption that you're a heterosexual man wrestling with unconfidence. Please remember that this is just my theorizing, offered in the hopes that it might be useful to you. I am not a therapist and this isn't a substitute for therapy (which I highly recommend).

### Confidence & You
First, what exactly _is_ confidence? 

For someone who doesn't feel confident, I know confidence can seem like a magical gift bestowed on others...  but not you. Confident men seem to have superhuman powers: seeming fearlessness, decisiveness, a decidedness of purpose, and a noted lack of fretting over past decisions. "Why," you might wonder, "Was I denied the gift?"

A confident man can't know the future any more than you can. Rather, **the confident man believes that whatever happens will be okay**. He believes this because he has experiences telling him it will be so, and therefore it only makes sense to him to be bold.

This "makes sense" aspect is important. 

Think of your childhood and adolescence (ages 0-18), and answer these questions:

- Were you criticized or punished for not achieving what your parents or social environment (e.g. school) wanted?
- When your desires differed from what your parents or social environment wanted, were you supported in those differences or forced to conform?
- Did challenging the rules feel scary or overwhelming?
- When you felt low or hurt, did you have an emotionally safe, nourishing, and restorative place to recharge?
- Did taking risks (e.g. talking to the girl you liked) not seem to work out for you?

If you resonate with one or more of these, consider this: the first ~18 years of your life are your most vulnerable. You don't have any financial resources of your own, you're not legally allowed to sign contracts, you don't understand how the world works, the planning & execution functions of your brain are still underdeveloped, you haven't yet learned social skills, and you're physically small & weak so you can't win fights.

When you're that vulnerable, and your parental/social environments demand that you conform to their reality rather than supporting you in defining your own, it only makes sense that you developed the caution & watchfulness that now presents as unconfidence. You were rewarded for discovering and obeying the rules of someone else's game, and maybe even punished for defining your own game.

Just as the confident man's experiences lead him to the conclusion of boldness, your experiences lead you to the conclusion of wariness. Our behaviours might seem crazy from the outside, and they might not be what serves us in the long term, but they _make sense_ to us in the moment.

### Blazing New Trails
You are no longer vulnerable like you were in the first 18 years of your life. You have resources of your own, and you no longer need to conform to parents or the school system. You likely realize that the cautiousness which was so essential when you were younger is now blocking you from taking certain risks that would be beneficial to you (talking to the women you want, pursuing job opportunities you want, standing up for yourself like you want, attempting new skills, etc). You'd like to become confident.

The great news is, my experience tells me you absolutely can. To understand how, let's go back to the "makes sense" aspect of behaviour. 

If unconfidence as a strategy was purely a result of the environment of your childhood & adolescence, you would have stopped being unconfident now that you're an adult out of that environment. Yet, unconfidence persists, so there must be something continuing to reward you for it.

To explore this, put yourself in the following scenarios and check in with what your inner voice is saying:
1. You're in a cafe, and a beautiful woman walks in. I urge you to go and talk to her.
1. Your boss tells you that they're going to take you out of your current role, and put you in charge of a project that's not doing well.
1. You're coming to meet me for coffee. When you're on the way, I let you know that I'm with a group of my friends there, who I'm going to introduce you to.
1. I, as your friend, tell you about a business deal I discovered: I've learned that a house is being sold privately at a significantly discounted price relative to the market. I offer for us to consider buying the house together, and flipping it for a profit.

What are you feeling in these scenarios? Perhaps, anxiety or trepidation? Caution? Resistance? The desire to decline?

If so, this makes sense given what you learned growing up. The environment of your younger years trained you to be very good at detecting and avoiding possible negatives (punishment, criticism), and you continue to do so today. "No" is the default, because it minimizes risk.

Now let's add some information on top of each scenario:

1. You saw another man talk to the woman in the café, and she brushed him off in a curt, dismissive way.
1. Your boss put another person in charge of the project, and it turned into a ton of work for that person.
1. When you arrive, you learn that my friends have known each other for years and they spend a lot of time talking amongst themselves. You feel awkward, and not quite included.
1. I do the deal on my own, and I struggle to sell the house for a while. When I eventually do sell it, it's barely for profit.

Now how do you feel about each scenario? Relieved? Justified in your caution? Validated?

If so, _this_ is what's keeping you chained to your strategy of unconfidence. You continue to reward yourself for identifying and avoiding the negative.

I designed the outcomes of the proposed scenarios to tap into your likely fears, but notice the alternate outcomes I omitted:

1. You talk to the woman in the café, and she's warm and kind. She seems to like you, and you exchange contact information to set up a date.
1. You take charge of the problematic project, and the project's issues resolve under your guidance. Your boss is impressed with your skill, and would like to give you a bonus for your handling of the situation.
1. When you arrive, my friends welcome you into the group and conversation flows easily. You enjoy chatting to them, and exchange contact information to hang out in the future. The seeds for some new friendships are planted.
1. You go in on the deal with me, and we flip the house in a few months for a 30% return on investment.

Did you contemplate these positive outcomes when you considered the original scenarios? If you did, did they seem too pie-in-the-sky or naive relative to the risks?

Focusing on the negative (which, again, is a _rational_ response to the environment you grew up in) creates a pain-avoidant, neutral-or-negative reality. If we don't have something and focus on it, we feel negative (pain). If we get it, we get back to neutral. If we a negative thing we're worrying about comes to pass, we feel bad because the negative thing occurs (pain). If we successfully anticipated and avoided it, we feel neutral (but not good) because we avoided pain.

Unfortunately, this mindset tends to filter out the positives which means taking risks (sensibly) feels not worth it.


for yourself in which it is difficult to feel good. If you successfully anticipate and avoid a negative, you feel relieved for not experiencing pain... but you don't feel good in the same way 

There was a study (which I heard in a podcast back in 2017, and cannot for the life of me find again) where an individual's perception of the world correlated with what they tended to focus on. People who focused on the negative felt that the world was a hostile, difficult place while people who focused on the positive felt the world was inviting and full of opportunity.

The strategy that was so essential for survival in your younger years, is now a hindrance.

The natural question becomes, why are you still implementing it?

Again, something about it _makes sense_ to do so. 

The great news is, you can learn to be confident. Doing so is a matter of creating for yourself the reference experiences of, "Yes, I will be okay no matter what." With time, it will simply m ake 


The way you behave now _makes sense_. It was a very sensible strategy developed to survive at a very vulnerable time in your life.

place you could go to were discouraged from trying or succeeding. Perhaps your family was negative. , or discouraged from trying, or his family was perpetually negative, or he didn't feel he had a safe and restoring place to return to when life beat him up. 
The unconfident man, by contrast, feels that volatility and the unknown are scary. He feels compelled to be careful.

My assertion: confidence is one's belief that whatever happens will be okay.


To the confident man, the unconfident man's caution seems completely unreasonable. Yet, **the unconfident man is not crazy: he feels this way for a reason**. 

I've yet to meet a man struggling with unconfidence who didn't have a past where he was punished for being bold. Perhaps he felt frequently criticized, or discouraged from trying, or his family was perpetually negative, or he didn't feel he had a safe and restoring place to return to when life beat him up. 

The man spent 18+ years in this environment, vulnerable to the whims of his caretakers. Within this context, unconfidence is a sensible survival strategy to avoid drawing attention so the man can preserve precious emotional energy & well-being.

The man is no longer vulnerable, but the survival strategy he developed persists. Now, it's damaging his life. He feels trapped, unable to take risks to pursue the opportunities he wants.

### Positivity Journalling
Fortunately, that survival strategy which is no longer useful can be replaced with one that serves the man better. Like anything, this is simply a matter of practice.

But what should the man practice? 

He should practice focusing on the positive in any circumstance.

It's important to understand that the environment of the unconfident man's formative years instilled a watchfulness in him. Because he didn't feel psychologically safe, he learned that he needed to be on the lookout for danger else bad things would happen. He now focuses mostly on identifying and avoiding negatives. 

This negative focus sets him up for constant stress. If the negative things he's worried about don't happen, he simply feels neutral (not "good", because there are always more negatives to watch out for). If they do happen, he feels like his fears have come to pass _and_ that his worrying was justified.

When the only two outcomes are feeling neutral-but-watchful and feeling bad, the man understandably feels pessimistic about the future. He feels a sense of scarcity, lack, and loss. Within this frame of reference, worrying and anxiety make sense.

To break the cycle, the man needs to start directing his focus to the positive aspects of a situation that he's not currently giving attention to. Repeated practice will train his mind to recognize that he's _always_ making forward progress, not just staying neutral or going backwards. 

How I can guarantee that a man is always making forward progress? Simply: the man is always learning. Even if everything goes to hell, the man still learned what to avoid in the future. He won't make the same mistakes, and is therefore upgraded.

With this positive mindset and some practice, the man's mind mind will learn that it can let go of some anxiety as _any_ situation can be turned to the man's advantage.

It's worth noting that at first, _focusing on the positive will feel bad to the man!_

For reasons that aren't yet clear to me, unconfident men often seem to derive a bitter comfort from focusing on the negative. They know that they're not getting what they long-term want. Yet, focusing on the negative might justify their anxiety in the short term (which, again, was a sensible strategy when they were young, when emotional energy was in short supply).

A tactic I've found useful in helping friends is repeatedly and relentlessly asking them to exercise their positivity muscle at the expense of their negativity muscle. I do this through Positivity Journalling, where I ask them to list out in complete sentences _only_ the things that are going well for them. This could be in the scope of his life, if he's feeling generally down, or it could be about an explicit event that's causing anxiety.

At first, he does it to humor me. But I ask him to pay attention to how he feels before doing it, versus after. Often, the man realizes that the situation wasn't as grim as he thought. He feels better.

I believe this inherent skepticism to be natural. We don't really believe in a tool until we see its tangible utility in our own lives. 

If you're struggling with anxiety, Positivity Journalling might be useful for you too. The next time you're feeling afraid, anxious, or wound-up, get a pen & paper and write down a bullet-point list of exclusively positive things going on in your life.

Some tips:
- Writing on a computer works too, but I don't think it's as effective as pen & paper because the slowness of writing by hand forces you to feel what you're writing. 
- Anything positive goes; even showing up for Positivity Journalling is a win.
- If you get stuck, think, "What have I learned recently?"
- Only positive things are allowed! You might be tempted to discount your wins (e.g. "I had a date last night... but I didn't really like her"). Ignore the negative; only the positive gets a voice.

When you come to a natural stopping point, ask yourself, "How do I feel compared to before I started?" If you feel better, that's good - you now have a tool that can practice to help you tame anxiety.

In my experience, consistently doing this exercise increases a man's belief in himself. He starts to turn down the volume on the negative thinking, leaving him freer to fail and be okay with it. His tolerance for risk-taking increases.

### On neediness & reactivity
I'd also like to comment on neediness and reactivity, as I believe they come hand-in-hand with unconfidence.

When a man is focusing on the negative, he needs reality to match his expectations. Anything less becomes fodder for a negative spiral in his mind. When reality matches his expectations, he feels uneasily okay. Yet, he can't relax because he feels he needs to spring into drastic, urgent action should things start to deviate from what he expects.

This man is _needy_ of reality, and he is _reactive_ to reality deviating from his expectations. His relationships might suffer because he appears anxious and stressed. He might be constantly trying to control reality (and inevitably losing).

When I'm feeling the need to control or take urgent action, I've found it useful to ask, "What do I feel I need right now?" I always find something lurking underneath, and I

### Conclusion
When a man switches to focusing on the positive, he is able to extract good from whatever result occurs. His life becomes a series of win-win's. Not because the chances of his preferred outcome are any higher, but because 

Rather than investing energy trying to tame uncontrollable reality, he uses his energy
