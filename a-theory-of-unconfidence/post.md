title: "A Theory Of Masculine Unconfidence"

_Written on 2024-09-16 & 2024-09-24_

I've recently been speaking to men who struggle with lack of confidence. I empathize with them, as I've wrestled with confidence issues for much of my life. I won't claim to have "solved" confidence, as I think it's a spectrum that one gets better at. But I do feel I've worked on the issue for long enough, and made enough personal headway, that I have something to contribute: a theory for what causes unconfidence, and how to fix it.

From here on, I'm going to address you, the reader, under the assumption that you're a man wrestling with unconfidence. Please remember that this is just my theorizing, offered in the hopes that it might be useful to you; I am not a therapist and this isn't a substitute for therapy (which I highly recommend).

### What is confidence?
First, what exactly _is_ confidence? 

For a guy wrestling with unconfidence, I know that confidence can seem like a magical gift bestowed on others...  but not you. Confident men seem to have superhuman powers: apparent fearlessness, decisiveness, a decidedness of purpose, and the ability to make a decision without worrying over it. "Why," you might wonder, "Was I denied the gift?"

My assertion: confidence is one's belief that whatever happens will be okay.

A confident man can't see the future any more than an unconfident man. Rather, the confident man moves decisively because he has experience thriving through life's turbulence. The unconfident man, by contrast, feels that volatility and the unknown are scary. He feels compelled to be careful.

To the confident man, the unconfident man's caution seems completely unreasonable. Yet, **the unconfident man is not crazy: he feels this way for a reason**. 

I've yet to meet a man struggling with unconfidence who didn't have a past where he was punished for being bold. Perhaps he felt frequently criticized, or discouraged from trying, or his family was perpetually negative, or he didn't feel he had a safe and restoring place to return to when life beat him up. 

The man spent 18+ years in this environment, vulnerable to the whims of his caretakers. Within this context, unconfidence is a sensible survival strategy to avoid drawing attention so the man can preserve precious emotional energy & well-being.

The man is no longer vulnerable, but the survival strategy he developed persists. Now, it's damaging his life. He feels trapped, unable to take risks to pursue the opportunities he wants.

### Positivity Journalling
Fortunately, that survival strategy which is no longer useful can be replaced with one that serves the man better. Like anything, this is simply a matter of practice.

But what should the man practice? 

He should practice focusing on the positive in any circumstance.

It's important to understand that the environment of the unconfident man's formative years instilled a watchfulness in him. Because he didn't feel psychologically safe, he learned that he had to be on the lookout for danger else bad things would happen. He now focuses mostly on identifying and avoiding negatives. 

This negative focus sets him up for constant stress. If the negative things he's worried about don't happen, he simply feels neutral (not "good", because there are always more negatives to watch out for). If they do happen, he feels like his fears have come to pass _and_ that his worrying was justified.

When the only two outcomes are feeling neutral-but-watchful and feeling bad, the man understandably feels pessimistic about the future. He feels a sense of scarcity, lack, and loss. Within this frame of reference, worrying and anxiety make sense.

To break the cycle, the man needs to start directing his focus to the positive aspects of a situation that he's not currently giving attention to. Repeated practice will train his mind to recognize that he's _always_ making forward progress, not just staying neutral or going backwards. 

You might be wondering how I can guarantee that a man is always making forward progress. Simply: the man is always learning. Even if every single thing goes to hell, the man still learned what things to avoid in the future. He won't make the same mistake again, and is therefore upgraded.

With this positive mindset and some practice, the man's mind mind will learn that it can let go of some anxiety as _any_ situation can be turned to the man's advantage.

It's worth noting that at first, _focusing on the positive will feel bad to the man!_

For reasons that aren't yet clear to me, unconfident men often seem to derive a bitter comfort from focusing on the negative. They know that they're not getting what they long-term want. Yet, focusing on the negative might justify their anxiety in the short term (which, again, was a sensible strategy when they were young, when emotional energy was in short supply).

A tactic I've found useful in helping friends is repeatedly and relentlessly forcing them to exercise their positivity muscle at the expense of their negativity muscle. I do this through Positivity Journalling, where I ask them to list out in complete sentences _only_ the things that are going well for them. This could be in the scope of his life, if he's feeling generally down, or it could be about an explicit event.

At first, the man does it to humor me. But I ask him to pay attention to how he feels before doing it, versus after. Often, the man realizes that the situation wasn't as grim as he thought. He feels better.

I believe this inherent skepticism to be natural. We don't really believe in a tool until we see its tangible utility in our own lives. 

If you're struggling with anxiety, perhaps Positivity Journalling will be useful for you too. The next time you're feeling afraid, anxious, or wound-up get a pen & paper and write down a bullet-point list of things that are going well in your life. 

Some tips:
- A computer works too, but isn't as good as pen & paper because the slowness of writing by hand forces you to feel what you're writing. 
- Anything positive goes; even showing up for Positivity Journalling is a win.
- If you get stuck, think, "What have I learned recently?"
- Only positive things are allowed! You might be tempted to discount your wins (e.g. "I had a date last night... but I didn't really like her"); only the good things are allowed.

When you come to a natural stopping point, ask yourself, "How do I feel compared to before I started?" If you feel better, great - you now have a tool that can help you turn down anxiety.

In my experience, consistently doing this exercise increases a man's belief in himself. He starts to turn down the volume on the negative thinking, leaving him freer to fail and be okay with it. His tolerance for risk-taking increases.

### On neediness & reactivity
I'd also like to comment on neediness and reactivity, as I believe they come hand-in-hand with unconfidence.

When a man is focusing on the negative, he needs reality to match his expectations. Anything less becomes fodder for a negative spiral in his mind. When reality matches his expectations, he feels uneasily okay. Yet, he can't relax because he feels he needs to spring into drastic, urgent action should things start to deviate from what he expects.

This man is _needy_ of reality, and he is _reactive_ to reality deviating from his expectations. His relationships might suffer because he appears anxious and stressed. He might be constantly trying to control reality (and inevitably losing).

When I'm feeling the need to control or take urgent action, I've found it useful to ask, "What do I feel I need right now?" I always find something lurking underneath, and I

### Conclusion
When a man switches to focusing on the positive, he is able to extract good from whatever result occurs. His life becomes a series of win-win's. Not because the chances of his preferred outcome are any higher, but because 

Rather than investing energy trying to tame uncontrollable reality, he uses his energy
