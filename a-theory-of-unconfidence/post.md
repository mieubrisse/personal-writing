title: "A Theory Of Male Unconfidence"

_Written on 2024-09-16_

I've recently been speaking to men who struggle with lack of confidence. I empathize with them, as I've wrestled with confidence issues for much of my life. I won't claim to have "solved" confidence, as I think it's a spectrum that one gets better at. But I do feel I've worked on the issue for long enough, and made enough personal headway, that I have something meaningful to contribute.

### What is confidence?
First, what exactly _is_ confidence? 

For an unconfident guy, confidence can seem like a magical gift bestowed on others but not them. Confident men seem to have superhuman powers: apparent fearlessness, decisiveness, a decidedness of purpose, and the ability to make a decision without worrying over it. "Why," the unconfident man might wonder, "Was I denied the gift?"

My layman's assertion: confidence is one's belief that whatever happens will be okay.

A confident man can't see the future any more than an unconfident man. Rather, the confident man moves decisively because he has experience thriving through life's turbulence. The unconfident man, by contrast, feels that volatility and the unknown are scary. He feels compelled to be careful.

To the confident man, the unconfident man seems crazy as he moves so cautiously. Yet, **the unconfident man is not crazy: he feels this way for a reason**. 

I've yet to meet a man struggling with unconfidence who didn't have a past where he was punished for being bold. Perhaps he felt frequently criticized, or discouraged from trying, or his family is perpetually negative, or he didn't feel he had a nourishing place to return to when life beat him up. 

The man had to spend 18+ years in this environment, vulnerable to the whims of his caretakers. Within this context, unconfidence is a sensible survival strategy to avoid drawing attention, to preserve emotional energy & well-being.

The man is no longer vulnerable, but the survival strategy he developed persists and now it's damaging his life. He feels trapped, unable to take risks to pursue opportunities like he wants.

### Positivity Journalling
Fortunately, with practice, unconfidence can be replaced by confidence. Doing so involves recognizing that **unconfidence and confidence are the results of a persistent focus on the negative and positive, respectively**.

This is why unconfidence is so hard to change. The unconfident man's default, well-practiced instinct is to focus on the negative. Even when he does push himself to take a risk, his mind obsesses over any failures and his subconscious internalizes the experiences as net negative. In the future, he'll believe that it's better not to try. This is a _rational behaviour_, given his past environment!

But, this man's default is not serving him. To upgrade his mindset to a more confident one freeing him to take the risks he wants, he needs to stop focusing on the negative and focus on the positive instead.

_This will feel bad to the man!_

For reasons that aren't yet clear to me, unconfident men often seem to derive a bitter comfort from focusing on the negative. They know that they're not getting what they long-term want. Yet, focusing on the negative might justify their inaction in the short term (which, again, makes sense when emotional energy was in short supply).

A tactic I've found useful in helping friends is repeatedly and relentlessly forcing them to exercise their positivity muscle at the expense of their negativity muscle. I do this through Positivity Journalling, where I ask them to list out _only_ the things that are going well for them. This could be in the scope of his life, if he's feeling generally down, or it could be about an explicit event.

The cool bit is there's _always_ something he can list. Even if everything went terribly, he still learned something and he's still showing up for Positivity Journalling. Often, the man realizes there's much more positive than he realized.

In my experience, consistently doing this exercise steadily increases a man's belief in himself. As he emphasizes the positive and deemphasizes the negative, he starts to mute the avalanche of negative thinking when he doesn't succeed. His tolerance for risk-taking increases.

### On neediness & reactivity
I'd also like to comment on neediness and reactivity, as I believe they come hand-in-hand with unconfidence.

When a man is focusing on the negative, he needs reality to match his expectations. Anything less becomes fodder for a negative spiral in his mind. When reality matches his expectations, he feels uneasily okay. Yet, he can't relax because he feels he needs to spring into drastic, urgent action should things start to deviate from what he expects.

This man is _needy_ of reality, and he is _reactive_ to reality deviating from his expectations. His relationships might suffer because he appears anxious and stressed. He might be constantly trying to control reality (and inevitably losing).

When I'm feeling the need to control or take urgent action, I've found it useful to ask, "What do I feel I need right now?" I always find something lurking underneath, and I

### Conclusion
When a man switches to focusing on the positive, he is able to extract good from whatever result occurs. His life becomes a series of win-win's. Not because the chances of his preferred outcome are any higher, but because 

Rather than investing energy trying to tame uncontrollable reality, he uses his energy
