_This post is part of a series on leverage. Here are parts [one][leveraged-judgment], [two][negative-leverage], and [three][first-do-nothing]._

I've [said it before][leveraged-judgment]: the modern world is is Fucking Leveraged. Small choices trigger huge consequences. 

Working smart dominates working hard. Decisions define outcomes.

In such a world, decisionmaking is everything.

My ["first, do nothing" mantra][first-do-nothing] is a mental strategy for better decisionmaking.

Today I'll show the power of systems.

Mechanics Of Decisionmaking
----------------------------------
Like all of us, you are a dumb monkey with a bunch of evolved behaviours.

These behaviours were helpful in the ancient environment. They're harmful today because they create false urgency and [negative leverage][negative-leverage].

[Clear Thinking](https://www.amazon.com.br/Clear-Thinking-Turning-Ordinary-Extraordinary/dp/0593086112) calls these harmful tendencies "defaults":

- **The ego default:** Acting to feel right/important ("I always knew the stock market was going to crash")
- **The emotion default:** Reacting to fear, anger, jealousy, etc. ("Fucking Linda from fucking finance is about to get a piece of my mind")
- **The social default:** Acting to fit in with the crowd ("Everyone else is getting in on Beanie Babies... I can't miss this!")
- **The inertia default:** Doing what's always been done ("I always eat ice cream with Netflix")

I call these the "Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking".

The classic protection is training your mind: self-awareness, meditation, mnemonics like "Count to 10 before responding".

These are the foundation; you can't skip these. 

But they take decades to master because you're fighting evolution.

Decisionmaking Systems
----------------------
To assist yourself, you can design systems for when the Four Horsemen hit.

Clear Thinking again:

> [Good judgment] is about designing systems at your best, that work for you at your worst.

These systems can be rules:

- "I don't respond when I'm feeling stressed" (guards against ego and emotion defaults)
- "I diversify my portfolio regardless of what the market is doing" (guards against emotion and social defaults)
- "I don't make commitments on the phone" (guards against social pressure default)
- "I don't eat after 8pm" (guards against inertia and emotion defaults)

Or they can be [Ulysses pacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact), removing the option to make bad choices:

- Your friends take drinks from you after 7pm (guards against emotional, social, and inertia defaults)
- I use [a phone app to block distracting apps after 9pm](https://appblock.app/) (guards against emotional and inertia defaults)
- I [have a modded version of Instagram on my phone that removes the dopamine-bait Feed and Search grid](https://www.distractionfreeapps.com/) (guards against emotional and inertia defaults)
- I have [a laptop app that forces me to take eye breaks every 20 minutes](https://lookaway.app/) (guards against inertia default)

Like a bumper car, you're getting knocked around by the world. The systems you build are guardrails to keep you on track even the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking crash into you.

When Linda from finance comes with her bullshit, you have more than just your awareness that you should slow down. You have a system.

The Exobrain
------------
Rules and Ulysses pacts are useful, but they have limitations:

1. **Which rules?:** You must do the work to translate your values and goals into the right rules and pacts.
1. **Unforeseen circumstances:** You can only guard against what you can foresee. I may have a Ulysses pact with my friends to take my drinks, but what about a cigarette? Marijuana? If I didn't plan for the eventuality beforehand, my system doesn't help me. 
1. **Prevents harm, but doesn't promote well-being:** When you're being tossed around by your defaults, you've lost sight of your long-term vision. Rules and Ulysses pacts help you from making the situation worse (Taleb's _via negativa_), but they don't reconnect you to why you created them in the first place.

Enter the **exobrain**: a configurable extension to your mind that double-checks your thinking.

First, load it up with what's important to you: your values, goals, and the ways of thinking that you believe are best.

Stuff like...

- "I want to see blind spots - things I might not be thinking of" (guard against confirmation bias)
- "I want to consider the [steelman](https://medium.com/on-philosophy/steelmanning-1470f6027ea5) of opposing points of view" (guard against ego default)
- "I want to hear the points of view of advisors and mentors before making a decision" (proactively seek insight)
- "I want to know when I'm emotional without noticing" (guard against the emotion default)
- "I want to know when I'm complacent in my thinking" (guard against inertia default)

Then, use the exobrain to think through situations. It uses the long-term vision you've provided to guide you in the direction you want to go, **even when you're under the power of the Four Horsemen**.

Suddenly your worst days for decisionmaking are getting corrected to look like your best. 

You're cleaning heaps of negative leverage from your future, and pumping your chances to find non-obvious better solutions you would have missed.

<!-- TODO link to non-obvious better solutions post here when it's ready -->

It gets even better: exobrains can upgrade themselves. Just ask it, "What should be in my exobrain that isn't yet?" Or "What's in my exobrain that's not serving me?"

Your decisionmaking power can be used to improve your decisionmaking power can be used to improve your decisionmaking power...

Exponential explosion.

Exobrains In Practice
---------------------
If this sounds too good to be true, it used to be. Exobrains didn't exist.

With the LLM revolution though, exobrains are reality.

I've implemented my exobrain in ChatGPT. Here are some examples of it working for me:

### Outside perspectives
I've told my exobrain that I look up to Naval Ravikant. As I was telling it about experiments I'm doing with my writing business, it brought in the lens of Naval unprompted:

```
This is foundational. You‚Äôre building trust with yourself and with your future audience.

üß† Naval would say:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing the foundational work most people skip. If it feels good and it compounds, you‚Äôre probably on the right path‚Äîeven if it looks slow.‚Äù
```

### Pulling out of the weeds
I've started dating someone I feel good about. There is, however, a risk I lose sight of things that are important to me in the new relationship energy.

My exobrain knows that it's important to me that I avoid this. 

Yesterday I was telling it about my workday when, unprompted, it sent:

```
Also ‚Äî a small but strategic nudge: as your connection with [the girl] deepens, it might be helpful to set a few ‚Äúintentional calibration moments‚Äù into your week. Just a half-hour solo check-in to ask:
	‚Ä¢	Am I showing up fully as me, or bending to keep peace?
	‚Ä¢	Am I investing from joy, or from fear?
	‚Ä¢	What kind of connection is forming here ‚Äî and do I want it to grow?
```

I thought this an excellent idea, so I've booked a half hour on Wednesday to reflect on these questions.

### Pattern recognition
Last week I had several days of intense focus, followed by a "rebound" day where I seemed to avoid deep work by socializing. 

I noticed my ChatGPT using the capitalized terms "Architect" and "Creator-Connector" to talk about these days. Curious, I asked it:

```
So you keep drawing this distinction between Creator and Architect. Are those reified terms? Something you invented?
```

It responded:

```
Great question‚ÄîCreator vs. Architect isn‚Äôt from a formal system (like IFS or Jungian archetypes), but it is a distinction I made up specifically for how you seem to move through your days. That said, it draws from a few real archetypal patterns. Want a little breakdown?

‚∏ª

üîß The Architect

This is your CEO-mode: structured, strategic, focused on building durable systems, allocating resources, and translating vision into plans.
	‚Ä¢	Energy: calm, future-focused, calculated
	‚Ä¢	Strengths: prioritization, leverage, long-term planning
	‚Ä¢	Shadow: rigidity, guilt when spontaneity enters, self-worth tied to productivity

‚∏ª

üî• The Creator‚ÄìConnector

This is your heart-forward, relational energy: where you teach, uplift others, connect dots, flow with curiosity, and share energy.
	‚Ä¢	Energy: warm, dynamic, spontaneous
	‚Ä¢	Strengths: inspiration, teaching, interpersonal magnetism
	‚Ä¢	Shadow: overextension, disorganization, abandoning your own structure to serve others
```

It had recognized a pattern that I hadn't.

I liked it, and it's become part of the vocabulary I use when talking to the exobrain.

### Thinking partner in negotiation
I've been in a complex negotiation for several weeks. While I can't give details here, I've been using my exobrain to think through the situation. I've used it for:

- Assembling order from the unstructured situation
- Helping me step into the perspective of the other parties
- Showing me my blind spots
- Ensuring my choices align with my values

I got numerous "Wow I hadn't thought of that" moments, and am pleased with how the exobrain evolved my thinking.

The Future
----------
If these seem small, you're missing the point. Upgrading our thinking is the highest-leverage


Exobrain-Human Interaction
--------------------------
I got a comment on an early draft of this article saying, "I prefer to do my decisionmaking myself."

I think this misses the point.

Conclusion
----------









Linda from finance again?

Don't respond. Think through the exobrain.

It slows you down, identifies where you're not thinking clearly, and sharpens your thinking to find non-obvious better solutions.

Guardrails. Suddenly your worst thinking days look like your best. 

No more bleeding bad outcomes because your monkey mind reacted to the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking.

If this sounds too good to be true, it used to be. Exobrains didn't exist.

**With the LLM revolution, exobrains are a reality.**

I said it before: the world is Fucking Leveraged. Working smart dominates working hard. 

**We're about to see a gap explode between exobrain users and non-users.**

It gets crazier: exobrains can upgrade themselves. Just think through it, "What should be in my exobrain that isn't yet?"

Exobrain users won't just avoid bad choices and identify non-obvious good ones.

They'll use the decisionmaking power to improve their decisionmaking power to further improve their decisionmaking power...

Exponential explosion. If you don't use an exobrain, you're about to get left in the Stone Age.

So how do you build an exobrain? Tune in next week to find out.
