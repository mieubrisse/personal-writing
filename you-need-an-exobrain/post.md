_This post is part of a series on leverage. Here are parts [one][leveraged-judgment], [two][negative-leverage], and [three][first-do-nothing]._

Deciding Monkeys
----------------
I've [said it before][leveraged-judgment]: the modern world is Fucking Leveraged. Small decisions trigger huge consequences. 

Working smart dominates working hard. Decisions define outcomes.

Make a shitty decision? Welcome to dozens of hours of work. If only you'd made the right decision that saves it.

<!--
"Wait, what about luck!" 

Good decisions _factor in_ luck. Pro poker players know this.

Naval:

> In 1,000 parallel universes, you want to be wealthy in 999 of them. You donâ€™t want to be wealthy in the 50 of them where you got lucky. We want to factor luck out of it.

Pity decisionmaking is to humans what air is to fish: real painful.

Default human thinking is lazy, emotional, and fast. [Kahneman's System 1 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=System%201%3A%20Fast%2C%20automatic%2C%20frequent%2C%20emotional%2C%20stereotypic%2C%20unconscious.).

This made sense in caveman times, as I've [said before][first-do-nothing]. Quick reactions were great at dealing with tigers and angry tribesmen.

Not so today. 

We overestimate urgency. We get reactive. We panic, and create more work for ourselves.

Oops... reacted without thinking and now my entire portfolio is Dogecoin.

We _can_ think clearly: ([Kahneman's System 2 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=System%202%3A%20Slow%2C%20effortful%2C%20infrequent%2C%20logical%2C%20calculating%2C%20conscious)). 

But it's slow and hard.

And really valuable.

If only I'd taken a moment to think: "Dogecoin... I don't even like dogs".

Decisionmaking Systems
----------------------
It's not that we don't know how to do good judgment.

It's that we get hijacked by the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking - what Clear Thinking calls the "defaults":

- **The ego default:** Acting to feel right/important ("I always knew the stock market was going to crash")
- **The emotion default:** Reacting to fear, anger, jealousy, etc. ("Fucking Linda from fucking finance is about to get a piece of my mind")
- **The social default:** Acting to fit in with the crowd ("Everyone else is getting in on Beanie Babies... I can't miss this!")
- **The inertia default:** Doing what's always been done ("I always eat ice cream with Netflix")

To save yourself from poor judgment, Clear Thinking advocates protective systems built when you're thinking clearly.

These can be rules:

- "I don't make decisions on the day I get big news" (guards against emotion default)
- "I don't respond when I'm feeling worked up" (guards against ego and emotion defaults)
- "I diversify my portfolio regardless of what the market is doing" (guards against emotion and social defaults)
- "I don't make commitments on the phone" (guards against social default)
- "I don't eat after 8pm" (guards against inertia and emotion defaults)

Or they can be [Ulysses pacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact) that take the power out of your hands:

- My friends take any drinks from me after 7pm (guards against emotional, social, and inertia defaults)
- I use [an app to block distracting apps after 9pm](https://appblock.app/) (guards against emotional and inertia defaults)
- I'm [forced to wait one second before I open Instagram](https://one-sec.app/) (guards against inertia default)

These systems are guardrails, that keep you on track when the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking hit.

> [Good judgment] is about designing systems at your best, that work for you at your worst.

The Exobrain
------------
Sure, rules and Ulysses pacts. Great.

But we're not Ancient Greeks. This is the 21st century.

Picture this: external brain that augments your thinking.

Load it up with your thinking best practices.

Things like...

- "I always want to consider [the steelman of the opposing point of view](https://medium.com/on-philosophy/steelmanning-1470f6027ea5)" (guard against ego default)
- "I always want to consider points of view I'm not thinking of" (guard against confirmation bias)
- "I always want to consult with other, more experienced people before making a decision" (proactively seek insight)
- "I want to know when I'm emotional without noticing" (guard against the emotion default)
- "I want to know when I'm complacent in my thinking" (guard against inertia default)

Then let it think for you.

Fucking Linda from finances with her bullshit again?

Don't respond. Think through the brain. What's the best move?

Suddenly your worst thinking days look like your best.

You've had a gaping hole in your thinking ability since the day you were born. 

It's been bleeding bad outcomes, and you've scrfamble

You fix a gaping hole in your thinking ability that's been bleeding bad outcomes since the day you crawled out of momma's womb. 

You'd drastically increase your outcomes.

Better still, this brain could improve itself. "I want to consider ways of thinking I'm not considering, and incorporate them."

This is the power of the **exobrain** - the external brain. With AI, it's now possible.

I'll show you how in the next post.
