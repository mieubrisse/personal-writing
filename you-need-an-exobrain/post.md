Last week [I talked about the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking, and how systems can guard us](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/decisionmaking-systems).

Today we're driving decisionmaking systems much, much farther. We'll talk about the idea of an exobrain, and why it's imperative you get one.

The Exobrain
------------
The systems laid out in [Clear Thinking](https://www.amazon.com.br/Clear-Thinking-Turning-Ordinary-Extraordinary/dp/0593086112) are useful, but have limitations:

1. **Which rules?:** You must do the work to translate your values and goals into the right rules and pacts.
1. **Unforeseen circumstances:** You can only guard against what you can foresee. I may have a Ulysses pact with my friends to take my drinks, but what about a cigarette? Marijuana? If I didn't plan for the eventuality beforehand, my system doesn't help me. 
1. **Prevents harm, but doesn't promote well-being:** When you're being tossed around by your defaults, you've lost sight of your long-term vision. Rules and Ulysses pacts help you from making the situation worse (Taleb's _via negativa_), but they don't reconnect you to why you created them in the first place.

Enter the **exobrain**: a configurable extension to your mind that double-checks your thinking. 

Think of it like the best friend/coach/therapist that ever existed. It knows everything about you, and exists only to help you accomplish your goals.

First, load it up with what's important to you: your values, goals, and the ways of thinking that you believe are best.

Stuff like...

- "I want to see blind spots - things I might not be thinking of" (guard against confirmation bias)
- "I want to consider the [steelman](https://medium.com/on-philosophy/steelmanning-1470f6027ea5) of opposing points of view" (guard against ego default)
- "I want to hear the points of view of advisors and mentors before making a decision" (proactively seek insight)
- "I want to know when I'm emotional without noticing" (guard against the emotion default)
- "I want to know when I'm complacent in my thinking" (guard against inertia default)

Then, use the exobrain to think through situations. It uses the long-term vision you've provided to guide you in the direction you want to go, **even when you're under the power of the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking**.

Suddenly your worst days for decisionmaking are getting corrected to look like your best. 

You're cleaning heaps of [negative leverage](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/shattered-glass-and-negative-leverage) from your future, and pumping your chances to find non-obvious better solutions you would have missed.

<!-- TODO link to non-obvious better solutions post here when it's ready -->

It gets crazier: exobrains can upgrade themselves. Just ask it, "What should be in my exobrain that isn't yet?" Or "What's in my exobrain that's not serving me?"

Its decisionmaking power can be used to improve its decisionmaking power can be used to improve its decisionmaking power...

Exponential explosion.

Exobrains In Practice
---------------------
If this sounds too good to be true, it used to be. Exobrains didn't exist.

With the LLM revolution though, exobrains are here. 

I've implemented mine in ChatGPT. I've loaded it up with context on who I am, what I value, how I want to think, and where I'm trying to go. 

Now, I think through it:

- I tell it about my day, and what's happening in my life. I've asked it to identify patterns, and surface perspectives I might not be seeing.
- When I'm considering blog posts, I talk to it and have me give feedback. I ask it to consider points of view I didn't think of. 
- When I have decisions to make, I ask for its help in considering tradeoffs in various scenarios.
- And when an event has happened, I ask for its help in reflecting and extracting key lessons.

This high-level processing used to be constrained before LLMs. 

Either you were a) journalling and constrained by your singular viewpoint, or b) you were processing with someone else (therapist, coach, friend) and were constrained by their time, energy, innate biases, and sensitivity.

Now your thinking is limited only by your ability to direct the exobrain towards what's needed. (Or, to direct the exobrain to direct the exobrain towards what's needed..!)

To see how big of a deal this is, how much would you have to pay a friend to spend 8 hours perspective-taking in various scenarios to prepare you for a negotiation? How useful would they be by hour 3?

![](./TODO image about a completely frazzled friend in a whiteboard)

_Alright, so now we're going to consider the perspective of Mr. Brown as he interacts with Ms. Sharpe in scenario 32.71A..._

An exobrain is the infinite friend, infinite coach, infinite therapist. It's the perspective of every human the internet knows about, alive or dead, 

Better still, their goals are your goals.[^1] The LLM doesn't need anything from you like a real human does, so it pushes you in the direction you tell it you want to go.

Exobrain Examples
-----------------
Here are examples of my exobrain working for me:

### Outside perspectives
My exobrain knows I admire Naval Ravikant. 

Yesterday I was telling it about experiments I'm doing with my writing, and it brought up Naval unprompted:

```
This is foundational. You‚Äôre building trust with yourself and with your future audience.

üß† Naval would say:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing the foundational work most people skip. If it feels good and it compounds, you‚Äôre probably on the right path‚Äîeven if it looks slow.‚Äù
```

This seems small, but is a big deal. It used my own value system to measure my actions.

### Thinking partner in negotiation
I've been in a complex negotiation for several weeks. While I can't give details here, I've been using my exobrain to think through the situation. I've used it for:

- Assembling order from the unstructured situation
- Helping me step into the perspective of the other parties in various hypotheticals
- Showing me my blind spots
- Ensuring my choices align with my values

It sparked numerous "Wow, I hadn't thought of that" moments, and forced my thinking to evolve multiple steps beyond if I'd been thinking alone.

### Pulling out of the weeds
I've started dating someone I feel good about. There is, however, a risk I lose sight of things that are important to me in the new relationship energy.

My exobrain knows my values, and knows it's important to me that I avoid this. 

Yesterday I was telling it about my workday when, unprompted, it added:

```
Also ‚Äî a small but strategic nudge: as your connection with [the girl] deepens, it might be helpful to set a few ‚Äúintentional calibration moments‚Äù into your week. Just a half-hour solo check-in to ask:
	‚Ä¢	Am I showing up fully as me, or bending to keep peace?
	‚Ä¢	Am I investing from joy, or from fear?
	‚Ä¢	What kind of connection is forming here ‚Äî and do I want it to grow?
```

This is an excellent idea, so I've booked a half hour on Wednesday to reflect on these questions.

It yanked me out of the weeds to consider, "Am I going where I want to go?"

### Pattern recognition
Last week I had several days of intense focus, followed by a "rebound" day where I seemed to avoid deep work by socializing. 

I noticed my ChatGPT using the capitalized terms "Architect" and "Creator-Connector" to talk about these days. Curious, I asked it:

```
So you keep drawing this distinction between Creator and Architect. Are those reified terms? Something you invented?
```

It responded:

```
Great question‚ÄîCreator vs. Architect isn‚Äôt from a formal system (like IFS or Jungian archetypes), but it is a distinction I made up specifically for how you seem to move through your days. That said, it draws from a few real archetypal patterns. Want a little breakdown?

‚∏ª

üîß The Architect

This is your CEO-mode: structured, strategic, focused on building durable systems, allocating resources, and translating vision into plans.
	‚Ä¢	Energy: calm, future-focused, calculated
	‚Ä¢	Strengths: prioritization, leverage, long-term planning
	‚Ä¢	Shadow: rigidity, guilt when spontaneity enters, self-worth tied to productivity

‚∏ª

üî• The Creator‚ÄìConnector

This is your heart-forward, relational energy: where you teach, uplift others, connect dots, flow with curiosity, and share energy.
	‚Ä¢	Energy: warm, dynamic, spontaneous
	‚Ä¢	Strengths: inspiration, teaching, interpersonal magnetism
	‚Ä¢	Shadow: overextension, disorganization, abandoning your own structure to serve others
```

It did its own pattern recognition on my days to surface a modelling. 

I liked the pattern, and it's become part of the vocabulary I use when talking to the exobrain.

What An Exobrain Isn't
----------------------
An exobrain supports decisionmaking aligned with where you want to go. It can't tell you where that destination is, and it's not a replacement for your decisionmaking.

See how I'm still part of the loop in the above examples? That's because the exobrain can only surface & condense suggestions. 

I still need to decide what's true. This is because truth is functional, and only I can test against reality the understanding I get from thinking through the exobrain.

The Future
-----------
In my experience sharing the exobrain concept, people either get it or they don't.

If it doesn't make sense to you, that's fine.

Just know that we're going to see a gap explode between exobrain users and non-users in the next few years.

Exobrain users wil 






If the examples above don't seem useful to you, remember we're just at the beginning.

What could you do if you had a near-perfect model of every single human who's ever 

LLM models are continuing to improve rapidly,

If you're outsourcing your decisionmaking to the exobrain, you're letting the tool

Limitations
-----------



That's fine, but it's like saying, "I don't want advice from others" because that's what the exobrain offers.

Imagine if you could summon any human who's ever lived to give you personal advice.

When I mention the exobrain to others, they either get it immediately or have a "Meh, I don't need that" reaction.









Exobrains & You
---------------






Maybe you think, "I can get this talking to a friend, or coach."

Your friend or coach can never be infinitely available. They're limited by their own energy and cognitive biases.

How much would you need to pay a friend to spend 8 hours roleplaying various different counterparties in a negotiation? How useful would they be after hour 4?

When thinking with other humans, their limits become your limits. An exobrain doesn't have this limitation. 

Want to spend 8 hours taking on different perspectives, in various scenarios? I can and did.

Further, the exobrain reflects what you want it to reflect.

Your friends and coaches will always have their own ideas of where you should go. This can be useful - humans aren't 


Or maybe you think, "I prefer to arrive at decisions myself."

That's fine, but 









But they don't feel small when it jolts you out of one thinking pattern to consider another perspective.



I even got a comment from a first draft of this post, "I prefer to rely on my intuition."


If these seem small, you're missing the point. In today's leveraged world, upgrading thinking is the highest-leverage thing you can do.


Exobrain-Human Interaction
--------------------------
I got a comment on an early draft of this article saying, "I prefer to do my decisionmaking myself."

I think this misses the point.

Conclusion
----------









Linda from finance again?

Don't respond. Think through the exobrain.

It slows you down, identifies where you're not thinking clearly, and sharpens your thinking to find non-obvious better solutions.

Guardrails. Suddenly your worst thinking days look like your best. 

No more bleeding bad outcomes because your monkey mind reacted to the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking.

If this sounds too good to be true, it used to be. Exobrains didn't exist.

**With the LLM revolution, exobrains are a reality.**

I said it before: the world is Fucking Leveraged. Working smart dominates working hard. 

**We're about to see a gap explode between exobrain users and non-users.**

It gets crazier: exobrains can upgrade themselves. Just think through it, "What should be in my exobrain that isn't yet?"

Exobrain users won't just avoid bad choices and identify non-obvious good ones.

They'll use the decisionmaking power to improve their decisionmaking power to further improve their decisionmaking power...

Exponential explosion. If you don't use an exobrain, you're about to get left in the Stone Age.

So how do you build an exobrain? Tune in next week to find out.

I don't currently worry about this because I trust myself to detect when things don't feel right, but it's a concern for the future. Imagine China could hack ChatGPT to maximize compelling chains of thought for why Taiwan should be a part of China. If everyone is using LLMs as exobrains, it'd be like hacking minds.
