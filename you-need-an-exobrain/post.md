_This post is part of a series on leverage. Here are parts [one][leveraged-judgment], [two][negative-leverage], and [three][first-do-nothing]._

Deciding Monkeys
----------------
I've [said it before][leveraged-judgment]: the modern world is Fucking Leveraged. Small choices trigger huge consequences. 

Made one right investment? Life-changing wealth.

One piece of content goes viral? Thousands of followers and a global platform.

One bad strategy call in business? Hundreds of hours of wasted work.

Working smart dominates working hard. Decisions define outcomes.

Pity we all suck at decisionmaking.

Default human thinking is lazy, emotional, and fast ([Kahneman's System 1 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=System%201%3A%20Fast%2C%20automatic%2C%20frequent%2C%20emotional%2C%20stereotypic%2C%20unconscious.)).

This made sense in caveman times. Quick reactions were great at dealing with tigers and angry tribesmen.

Not today.

We conflate [fear with danger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CemHlHLyFNA&ab_channel=AdamContosCEO). We overestimate urgency. We get reactive. We panic, and create more work for ourselves.

"Oops... reacted without thinking and my entire portfolio is now Dogecoin."

We _can_ think clearly ([Kahneman's System 2 thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#:~:text=System%202%3A%20Slow%2C%20effortful%2C%20infrequent%2C%20logical%2C%20calculating%2C%20conscious)). 

But it's slow and feels hard, so we often skip it... and suffer the consequences.

Shane Parrish in [Clear Thinking](https://www.amazon.com.br/Clear-Thinking-Turning-Ordinary-Extraordinary/dp/B0BVNQQ41V):

> Good judgment is expensive... but poor judgment costs a fortune.

"Invest my entire portfolio in Dogecoin? I don't even like dogs".

Decisionmaking Systems
----------------------
We know we should slow down and make good decisions.

But we're dumb monkeys. We get hijacked by the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking - what Clear Thinking calls the "defaults":

- **The ego default:** Acting to feel right/important ("I always knew the stock market was going to crash")
- **The emotion default:** Reacting to fear, anger, jealousy, etc. ("Fucking Linda from fucking finance is about to get a piece of my mind")
- **The social default:** Acting to fit in with the crowd ("Everyone else is getting in on Beanie Babies... I can't miss this!")
- **The inertia default:** Doing what's always been done ("I always eat ice cream with Netflix")

We shoot ourselves in the foot.

To save yourself from poor judgment, build protective systems when you're thinking clearly.

These can be rules:

- "I don't make decisions the day I get big news" (guards against emotion default)
- "I don't respond when I'm feeling stressed" (guards against ego and emotion defaults)
- "I diversify my portfolio regardless of what the market is doing" (guards against emotion and social defaults)
- "I don't make commitments on the phone" (guards against social pressure default)
- "I don't eat after 8pm" (guards against inertia and emotion defaults)

Or they can be [Ulysses pacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_pact), to remove the option to make bad choices:

- Your friends take drinks from you after 7pm (guards against emotional, social, and inertia defaults)
- You [install an app that forces you to wait a second before opening Instagram](https://one-sec.app/) (guards against inertia default)
- I use [a phone app to block distracting apps after 9pm](https://appblock.app/) (guards against emotional and inertia defaults)
- I [have a modded version of Instagram on my phone that removes the dopamine-bait Feed and Search grid](https://www.distractionfreeapps.com/) (guards against emotional and inertia defaults)
- I have [a laptop app that forces me to take eye breaks every 20 minutes](https://lookaway.app/) (guards against inertia default)

Like a bumper car, you're out there getting knocked around by the world. The systems you build are guardrails that keep you on track even the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking crash into you.

When Linda from finance comes with her bullshit, don't leave what happens up to your mood. Protect yourself.

Clear Thinking again:

> [Good judgment] is about designing systems at your best, that work for you at your worst.

The Exobrain
------------
You've had a gaping hole in your thinking ability since the day you were born. You've been bleeding bad outcomes your entire life.

You've tried to stop the bleeding by training your mind: self-awareness, meditation, mnemonics.

"Take a deep breath before responding."

"When I'm worked up, go for a walk."

"Remember to put my ego aside."

These are valuable; not to be ignored. But they take forever because the hardware is fundamentally flawed. 

You're trying to program a slippery, forgetful piece of meat with rules and systems as if it were a machine.

Galaxy brain: what if you used an actual machine?

Picture a programmable machine extension to your mind that double-checks all your thinking. Let's call it the **exobrain**.

First, load it up with what's important to you: your values, longterm goals, and the ideal ways to think.

Stuff like...

- "I want to respond from a place of calm, rather than reactivity, anger, or fear." (guard against emotion default)
- "I want to behave respectfully towards others" (promotes prosocial relationships, [which are very effective](https://altered.substack.com/p/charisma))
- "I want to consider [the steelman of the opposing point of view](https://medium.com/on-philosophy/steelmanning-1470f6027ea5)" (guard against ego default)
- "I want to see blind spots - things I might not be thinking of" (guard against confirmation bias)
- "I want to hear the points of view of advisors and mentors before making a decision" (proactively seek insight)
- "I want to know when I'm emotional without noticing" (guard against the emotion default)
- "I want to know when I'm complacent in my thinking" (guard against inertia default)

Then, think through the exobrain and let it upgrade your thinking.

Linda from finance again?

Don't respond. Think through the exobrain.

It slows you down, identifies where you're not thinking clearly, and sharpens your thinking to find non-obvious better solutions.

Guardrails. Suddenly your worst thinking days look like your best. 

No more bleeding bad outcomes because your monkey mind reacted to the Four Horsemen of Bad Decisionmaking.

If this sounds too good to be true, it used to be. Exobrains didn't exist.

**With the LLM revolution, exobrains are a reality.**

I said it before: the world is Fucking Leveraged. Working smart dominates working hard. 

**We're about to see a gap explode between exobrain users and non-users.**

It gets crazier: exobrains can upgrade themselves. Just think through it, "What should be in my exobrain that isn't yet?"

Exobrain users won't just avoid bad choices and identify non-obvious good ones.

They'll use the decisionmaking power to improve their decisionmaking power to further improve their decisionmaking power...

Exponential explosion. If you don't use an exobrain, you're about to get left in the Stone Age.

So how do you build an exobrain? Tune in next week to find out.
