Alfred Binet of IQ test had to make an embarrassing public omission. From Wiki:

> Unfortunately, the conclusions of Charcot, Binet and F√©r√© did not stand up to the professional scrutiny of Joseph Delboeuf, who concluded that the findings were due to the fact that the patients knew what was expected, what should happen, and they just agreed.[7] Binet felt obliged to make an embarrassing public admission that he had been wrong in supporting his teacher. 

Charlie Munger said that Judith Rich Harris had to apologize for her previous work

If you're not embarrassed by your earlier beliefs, you're not growing fast enough

Society teaches us to pounce when people make admissions. This is dumb!!! We should LOVE people who recognize and admit their errors!

Honor culture is dumb (Alexander Hamilton duel - world lost a great genius, just because of stupid honor)
