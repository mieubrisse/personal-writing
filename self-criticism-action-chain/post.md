title: "Self-Criticism Action Chain"
---

_Written on 2024-05-21_

I've recently been diving deep into the way I work, and how that manifests in my relations with others. One thing has popped to the forefront: I am currently dependent on the outside world for validation.

Concretely, this looks like so: the answer to the question, "Am I worthy?" is dependent on the answer to the question, "Do I have X?" where X can be any of the following depending on the day: money, respect, exciting romances, a successful business, a muscular body, money, cool travel/party experiences, etc. 

I call this mental profile being Externally-Validated. I need things from the outside world to feel good about myself, and if I don't have them I feel bad/unworthy. When this is true, I'm forced to seek ever greater control over the world around me to feel good and avoid feeling bad. 

Yet, life is simply beyond our power to govern. Spending every hour of every day trying to control my surroundings doesn't guarantee bad things won't happen: I could get a surprise cancer, or be caught in an earthquake, or get injured in a surprise structural failure. When I am Externally-Validated, I am fighting a battle to feel good for a little while in what is ultimately a doomed war.

The alternative is being Internally-Validated. The answer to the question, "Am I worthy?" doesn't rely on anything beyond my control. It is instead answered by things like, "Am I behaving in a way I consider just?" or "Am I behaving in accordance with my morals?".

This sounds nice of course, but I needed to understand _why_ I'm Externally-Validated to start to make the shift. I now believe the answer lies in where I'm choosing to direct my focus.

My default tendency is to focus on the negative side of things. I've therefore acquired an action chain that looks as follows:

1. I focus on the negative side of events
1. The constant negativity barrage leads to a fear/scarcity/avoidance belief
1. To guard against the fear, I seek X
1. X is given or not as life goes, and I am enslaved to external events to feel good
