The Psychic War
===============
TODO SUBTITLE TEX

![](./images/image.png)

Reading The Almanack of Naval Ravikant last year taught me that **your mind is the ultimate leverage point**.

Upgrade a belief to create habits that generate more energy and success for you to invest in upgrading more beliefs.

Learn a better way to do something, save some time, and use the time saved to learn even more things to save even more time.

Show someone how their actions don't align with their beliefs and remove hours of nagging.

If you can work smart, you remove hours of toil (negative leverage), thereby creating more time to invest in working smarter, thereby freeing up _more_ time.

...assuming, you're investing that time in working smarter.

In practice, most of us spend our free time on brain junkfood: TV, social media, memes, low-value entertainment. 

It's not just a waste of time during consumption.

Your brain is getting loaded with emotionally-charged crap that yanks you off track: celebrity gossip, clickbait, politics that make you angry but can't do anything about. 

<!-- Our brains think "I'm feeling emotions about this... it must be important!" Great algorithm in the ancient environment, terrible in the 21st century. -->

I started to notice this in myself when observing how a "quick" funny Instagram reel affects me.

Maybe I was having deep, useful thoughts about work and AI. That one damn reel completely reroutes my thinking towards useless nonsense.

Maybe it's a reel of two Brazilian politicians arguing. In a blink I'm twenty minutes deep in a rabbithole about the politics of Brazil. In the worst cases, I'm sucked into a black hole of triviality for hours, the previous deep work completely lost.

When this happens, we say "I need to be more disciplined".

...which is what companies like Facebook and Netflix and Google want you to think.

If the problem is discipline, it's a you problem. A personal failure.

Yet these companies spend hundreds of millions on psychologists and engineers to construct tech that never sleeps, hunting your attention everywhere you're online.

And it's not just social media. Amazon's reminding me to review a product, Linkedin's trying to shove feeds into my inbox, and everywhere sites "forget" that I unsubscribed from their marketing newsletter.

It's not a personal failure. It's a systems failure, and we are outmatched. They have a powerful weapon, and we think we just need to work harder.

They've gotten inside our minds.

Conclusion
----------
In the next week or two I'll write up how I've built my own defense system.

But it doesn't have to be this way. The enemy's using tech, and we can too. If they've built offensive systems, we need defensive ones.

### Defense Systems
Unfortunately, it's not as simple as blanket blocking social media or Youtube or Reddit.

I've tried, and life just gets harder. How do you preview a restaurant with no Instagram? How do you watch that insightful video your friend sent you with no Youtube?

Which, of course, is also intentional. Draw you in with good, useful stuff and keep you on the platform with addicting emotional stuff.

Insight: build a defense system that strips the bad while keeping the good.

Examples:
- Adblockers WHILE paying for content I like, because you should never teach yourself to consume without giving value back)
- A Chrome extension & Android app to block the Instagram feed
- A Chrome extension to block Youtube's addicting features (autoplay, sidebar, end-of-video related content)
-

For me, this looks like:

- Adblockers 
- Chrome 
- 






Meaning, you should be investing 

With AI, we can finally program this. If I had shoddy thinking pre-2023, the best I could do was hire a coach available an hour per week for $100/hour. Or more.

Now, I can create agents to check my thinking, expand my ideas, and help me find those non-obvious better moves.

Those better moves lead to less waste ([negative leverage]), which we can invest in more reading, more systems, more improvements.

That bitch is exponential.

I captured the creed of 





The most leveraged investment is our mind.

Upgrade a belief, and you upgrade actions. 

This shit gets exponential.
