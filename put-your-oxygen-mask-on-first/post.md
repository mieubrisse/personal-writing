title: "Put On Your Oxygen Mask Before Helping Others"
---

_Written on 2024-08-25_

This April, my cofounder and former best friend fired me from the business he and I founded three and a half years ago. 

Today, four months later, I consider it one of the best things to happen to me. I am happier now than I have ever been in my life.

How did this happen?

Death
-----
In my cofounder's words, his decision to fire me was based on his belief that my behaviour within the organization was harmful to team culture, and distracting from the business' goal of finding product-market fit. He believed that for me to change would require years, if I could even change at all, and it wasn't in the business' best interest to hope for that.

He was absolutely right that I hadn't been fun to be around last year. Particularly in the latter half of 2023, I had let myself get into a stressed and burnt-out state. Some team members felt that I was overly controlling and defensive, and some good people quit. I was forced to face the reality that my leadership style wasn't working, which [I wrote about here](../suffering/post.md).

Yet, I disagreed with his assessment that the cons of me being at the organization outweighed the pros, and that I would take years (or a lifetime) to change. The firing had come as a surprise, and I felt angry, unheard, betrayed, and ashamed. I wanted to fight: shout at him, muster data, prove him wrong. 

But... in the wake of 2023, I'd started to take a closer look at my behavioural defaults and how they affect my relationships. In one late-night journalling session, I identified a pattern of going on the attack when I felt criticized without being empathized with. Further, I identified that I'd acquired this pattern from my parents, who might have acquired it from their parents.

It dawned on me that the way I behaved with our employees was the way I'd behave with my children, and if I didn't make a change I'd continue the generational cycle. 

I'd spent so much of my life fighting to make something of myself: to understand why I didn't fit in when I was younger, to be heard & respected, to acquire money & interesting experiences, to be muscular and strong, to be good at skills, to date the women I wanted. I had one large [Warrior energy](https://www.amazon.com/King-Warrior-Magician-Lover-Rediscovering/dp/0062506064) hammer, everything looked like a nail, and it was causing problems in my life.

I'd recently been reading a trifecta of intriguing Buddhism-inspired books - [The Way Of The Peaceful Warrior](https://www.amazon.com/Way-Peaceful-Warrior-Changes-Lives/dp/1932073205), [The Surrender Experiment](https://www.amazon.com/Surrender-Experiment-Journey-Lifes-Perfection/dp/080414110X), and [The Untethered Soul](https://www.amazon.com/Untethered-Soul-Journey-Beyond-Yourself/dp/1572245379) - so I decided to try a different strategy: surrender. 

I didn't resist my cofounder. I was terminated from my own startup.

Rebirth
-------
### Grudges
Despite my strategic call to explore surrender, the emotional tempest raged. I had nights where I was so angry I couldn't sleep. I wrestled with the agony that I was now damaged goods, and nobody would want to work with me again. I felt like a failure who needed to hide what had happened from my other entrepreneur friends.

Thankfully, I'm surrounded by good, wholesome people who inspire me to greatness. My therapist encouraged me to experience the emotions rather than run from them, so I turned to journalling and conversations with friends rather than reach for Youtube and substances as I might have in years past.

Turns out, therapists know a few things.

In the process of processing and re-processing and re-re-processing, I realized that my anger at my former cofounder was controlling me. Or, more specifically, I was _letting_ myself be controlled by my own anger: imprisoning myself in a cage I was creating, letting him live rent-free in my head.

I began to perceive previously-unseen depth to the lyrics of [Tool's "The Grudge"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BXyEUOuNds):

> Wear the grudge like a crown
> Desperate to control
> Unable to forgive
> And sinking deeper..

Could I forgive my cofounder - not as a favor to him, but for myself?

### Volunteering
While I explored these thoughts, a chance encounter led me to volunteer at [a project in São Paulo that makes & distributes meal kits for the homeless](https://www.projetogaia.com.br/). I found it soothing to switch off my brain wracked with problems concerning me, and lose myself in making as many meal kits as quickly as possible. To be maximally useful to others.

As I came back week after week, I began to notice a change: giving to others made me feel innately valuable and fulfilled. This feeling contrasted with the Warrior mindset I'd lived life with up till this point: needing to fight for being valuable and fulfilled.

When I'd been focusing on what I didn't have and wanted, I'd been living in a state of lack - a scarcity mindset that felt stressful to be inside. When I focused on giving, I directed my attention to what I had available to give - an abundance mindset that felt peaceful.¹

I started to connect the dots on how I'd been creating my own vicious cycle: focusing on what I didn't have generated feelings of lack and scarcity, which raked the exposed nerves of feeling not enough, which inspired stress, which made me feel like I had to take drastic, forceful action... including to perceived unempathetic criticism from the team. This meant I wasn't fun to be around, which pushed people away, which made me yearn for unfulfilled connection & understanding... and the cycle would spin.

### Unconditionally Okay
[Transactional Analysis calls this mindset "I'm Not Okay"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_OK_%E2%80%93_You%27re_OK#Four_life_positions). More specifically, I call it conditionally-Okay: I only felt "I'm Okay" if reality proceeded according to my expectations. If they deviated (including, if I didn't feel listened to or heard), I felt that I needed to react immediately to correct. 

I began to understand what "neediness" actually is: needing things from reality, thereby allowing my happiness to be controlled by reality's whims.

Could I be free? Could I feel unconditionally "I'm Okay", thereby breaking the vicious cycle?

Yes, suggested Mickey Singer in "The Untethered Soul", if only I let go of my expectations that chain me to reality's outcomes. I cannot control what reality does, but I can control how I react to it.

As I began to look at the world through this interesting new lens, I started to notice all the ways I was letting my Okay-ness be determined by life. E.g.:

- I needed my cofounder to make amends for the injustice I'd perceived as done to me
- I would feel disappointed if the meal I ordered wasn't good
- I would feel angry if someone did something I perceived as disrespectful
- I would feel irritated if somebody interrupted me while speaking
- I would feel disappointed or anxious if the woman I liked didn't like me back

Buddhism calls anger and desire "poisons", and I began to see why. By choosing to cling to them, I was making a choice to live minutes, hours, or days of my finite life in a state of unhappiness.

Mickey Singer says, "Most people say they want to be happy. What they really mean is, they want to be happy only when things go to plan."

### The Mental Side Of "I'm Okay"
I started to monitor my internal state more closely via journalling. Just as smoke signals fire, I noticed that I could quest into anxiety and reliably discover some unresolved expectation (which I often wasn't even aware I had). Perhaps I'd been comparing myself to a successful man on Instagram and not feeling good enough, or perhaps I felt ashamed to not have a job in relation to my entrepreneur friends, or perhaps I felt like I wasn't being respected in a relationship. 

The journalling process was always similar: I would write out what I was feeling, uncover what was causing it, express it to my satisfaction, and ultimately end up engaging the [Positive Voice that I've been training for a couple years](../the-positive-voice/post.md) to shift myself out of a stressed/scarcity/reactive mindset to a calm/abundance/non-reactive mindset. I developed self-soothing behaviours, such as:

- Writing and saying out loud, "It's all going to be okay. You don't have to react to X" (where X is the anxiety-causing event of the day)
- Reminding myself that "Comparison is the thief of joy" when I caught myself comparing myself to others, and switch instead to comparing me now with myself a month ago
- Reminding myself that "You don't need more intensity; you need more consistency" when I found myself feeling impatient with progress in an area, wanting to take drastic action
- Writing out and saying out loud, "You are worthy of love & affection, exactly as you are" when I found myself feeling isolated
- Observing the wave nature of fear/anxiety: it starts, builds, grows, crests, and then diminishes if only I don't react to it

Journalling became a sort of massage for mental knots: painful at first, but ultimately curative.

I also began to see the tactical value in meditation. 

Previously, I'd viewed meditation as akin to mental weightlifting: I knew I should do it and I knew it had data-backed benefits, but it was hard to translate those abstract benefits into something useful for my day-to-day. 

Now, I began to use meditation as a quick-response tool for halving my anxiety in only 10 minutes, allowing me to insert space between stimulus response and choose better, less-obvious courses of action. I also began to see how meditation teaches me to surrender to what Is. Any given 10-minute session is invariably interrupted by external sounds, or bodily discomfort, or even mosquitos. I now view these events as fodder to practice letting go of my irritation and desire to shift around.

### The Physical Side Of "I'm Okay"
I've been fortunate enough with my finances to not need to return to work immediately, and as a result I have an abundance of time for the first time in my adult life. I've realized that this extra time is its own sort of remedy: I have plenty of free time to schedule a given thing I want to do, which means I don't need to stress about fitting the thing into one of my precious few free slots and don't have to make hard prioritization calls as a result of being overbooked.

I've been reminded of the phrase "busyness is a choice" and its sister phrase [from 37Signals, "'No' is no to one thing; 'Yes' is no to many things."](TODO). Simply by having less to do, I am less stressed and therefore less reactive.

With this newfound time, I've discovered that maintaining physical activity is easy. Previously, the gym felt like an obligation; I now realize this is because it was a good chunk of time that needed to be slotted into an already-full schedule. Now, my gym sessions are stretching towards two hours, and my rock climbing sessions towards three, purely because I'm enjoying them and don't need to be anywhere else.

As a consequence, I'm gaining muscle mass quickly and am in some of the best shape I've ever been in. My diet is also quite clean, because I have the time to plan meals and select the food I want rather than scrambling to eat whatever's available.

### The Social Side Of "I'm Okay"
There's a phrase, "You can only love others as much as you love yourself." Its truth has now become deeply apparent to me.

When I wasn't taking care of myself, I needed reality (and those around me) to take care of me. I had little free energy to give to other people, because whenever reality didn't take care of me I'd feel drained by anger or disappointment.

Now that I'm taking better care of myself and working to accept what Is, I find I exist in a freer state with more energy to give to others. This has led to people in my life telling me, "You're very giving", "You feel zen", and "You're so positive". These descriptors most definitely wouldn't have applied to me a year ago.

I got into my vicious cycle via a conditionally-Okay mindset, that I was only good enough if I got the things I was expecting/striving for. I'm starting to see how Western (perhaps global?) culture is filled with this tradition of comparison, competition, and anxiety. If many other people are feeling the same way that I did, then can I bring the gift of unconditional Okay-ness to to others? The "You're Okay" part of Transactional Analysis?

Doing so would mean taking the same kindness and self-belief that I've been cultivating for myself and extending it to others. In a capitalistic world, this too might be something else that I can give to others beyond the labor of my own two hands.

### The Results





Four months after my cofounder fired me, the work I've been putting in has been paying off. I now tend to move towards emotional equilibrium after emotionally-destabilizing events in everyday life. I find myself feeling calmer, and happier. People around me have begun to comment that I have a positive, giving, zen vibe.

¹ There seem to be scientific basis for this: [according to Andrew Huberman](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/master-stress-tools-for-managing-stress-anxiety/id1545953110?i=1000512053623), dopamine inspires us to action & seeking behaviour while seratonin inspires feelings of (among other things) fulfillment and enough-ness. Dopamine is also the precursor molecule to norepinephrine (basically adrenaline), while seratonin is the precursor molecule to melatonin (which helps us fall asleep).

When I focused on what I lacked, I felt anxious & stressed (leading to unproductive intea. When I focused on what I had, I felt fulfilled.
