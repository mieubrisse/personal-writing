I was distracted yesterday and knocked a glass off my table. It exploded everywhere.

I was barefoot. I remembered my parents urging us to put on shoes before cleaning up broken glass. Sensible.

But I had a novel thought: what if I cleaned up the glass barefoot?

That's insane.

But there was logic to it: I'm not going to wear shoes forever in my apartment. If I wear shoes during the cleanup, I could miss shards that I'll only find the next time I'm barefoot. 

I just watched the glass shatter, so I'm cautious right now. Days later I might not be, leading to a worse injury.

So I cleaned it up barefoot. I stepped carefully in clear areas, using any felt pricks as shard alerts. Things seemed to proceed smoothly.

My first hint I'd miscalculated came when sweeping at the end, after all the big pieces were gone. 

I'd assumed all the glass shards would be visible. The size of a pen tip, at smallest.

But what I swept up was glass dust. Miniscule fragments which would have been invisible if I hadn't collected them into a pile.

I'd been careful to step in areas that looked free of glass. But when I inspected the bottom of my feet, they glimmered full of tiny shimmering remnants I hadn't felt.

A little shaken, I washed my feet and took extra care when vacuuming.

My sheet brushed my toe while I lay in bed that night, and I felt a sharp pain. I knew I'd gotten a glass splinter without noticing, but spent 30 minutes failing to locate it.

As I wait for my body to expel the splinter naturally, I'm reflecting on what I've learned (because you either win or you learn).

### Negative Leverage
If I'd been in less of a rush, I wouldn't have knocked the glass over. I would have saved myself all the cleanup.

But even with the glass shattered, shoes would have saved me time trying to remove the splinter. Not to mention the mental toll of the splinter.

I define leverage as small inputs causing big outputs. 

In these cases, I experienced "negative leverage". My small actions caused me hours of work.

Think to your own life. Do any of these sound familiar?

- "Just a bit of Instagram" turns into hours of doom-scrolling, sleep deprivation, and unhealthy food choices the next day.
- "Just one Netflix episode" ends on a cliffhanger, leaving you dying to know what happens next, which pulls you into a multi-episode binge.
- A "quick glance" at email after work reveals a stressful email that makes you anxious all night, corrupting your sleep and time with your loved ones.
- One thing said in the heat of anger turns into hours repairing a relationship.
- "Just one more drink" turns into a night of drinking, sleeping late, a hangover, and a wasted next day.

Everything changes if you'd opened a book instead of Instagram or Netflix, didn't check your email, took a breath before responding.

Warren Buffet's business partner Charlie Munger has this to say:

> It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent

Nassim Taleb calls this "avoiding what not to do" approach _via negativa_.

Are there you making any small choices in your life that are ballooning into bad outcomes?

_Big thanks to [Tarik Guney](https://www.forgingforward.co/p/charlie-mungers-dont-make-big-mistakes) and [Chris Meyer](https://themindcollection.com/via-negativa/) for their articles which propelled my thinking on negative leverage_

### The Danger Of Unchecked Assumptions
My experiment rested on two assumptions:

1. **I'd be able to see all glass shards.** This relied on an incorrect belief about the way glass shatters. Namely, about how small shards could be.
2. **I'd immediately feel stepping on a shard.** This relied on an incorrect belief about what stepping on a shard would be like. It was supported by the belief about how small shards could be.

This wasn't crazy; I can't remember ever having a glass splinter before. I just assumed.

Now, I wasn't 

Reflecting, this belief about how small shards could be was driven by experience. I don't remember seeing such tiny glass before as a kid.

### Technology Is Leverage
My choice to go barefoot was anti-leverage. Making the small choice to wear shoes.
