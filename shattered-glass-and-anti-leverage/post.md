Yesterday I was distracted and knocked a glass off my table. It exploded everywhere.

I was barefoot. I recollected my parents urging us to put on shoes before cleaning up broken glass. Sensible.

Yet I had a novel thought: what if I cleaned the glass up barefoot?

Crazy, I know. 

But the logic went like this: I'm not going to wear shoes forever in my apartment. If I wear shoes during the cleanup, I might be missing glass shards that I'll only find the next time I'm barefoot. I just watched the glass shatter, so I'm extra cautious right now. Days later I might not be, leading to a worse injury.

So I did it. I stepped carefully in clear areas, using any pricks as signal of a shard. Things seemed to proceed smoothly.

My first hint that I'd miscalculated came when sweeping at the end, after all the big pieces were gone. 

I'd assumed there would be a small-but-reasonable size that the glass shards wouldn't go under. The size of the tip of a pen, perhaps. Small, but still visible. 

But what I swept up was glass dust. Miniscule fragments that would have been invisible if I hadn't swept them into a pile.

I'd been careful to step in areas that seemed free of glass. But when I inspected the bottom of my feet, they were full of tiny shimmering bits that I hadn't felt.

A little shaken, I washed my feet and did an extra thorough job with vacuuming.

During the night my sheet brushed my toe and I felt a sudden sharp pain. I intuited I'd gotten a glass splinter without noticing, but spent 30 minutes failing to locate it.

As I wait for my body to expel the splinter naturally, I'm reflecting on what I've learned (because you either win or you learn).

### The Butterfly Effect
If I'd been in less of a rush, I wouldn't have knocked the glass over. I would have saved myself the cup, a glass splinter and nearly an hour of cleanup. Not to mention the mental toll of having a splinter.

But even with the glass shattered, shoes would have saved me the splinter.

One small choice can have huge consequences. The butterfly effect is real.

Think to your own life. Maybe you've been in scenarios like these:

- "Just a bit of Instagram" turns into hours of doom-scrolling, sleep deprivation, and unhealthy food choices the next day.
- A "quick glance at email" after work reveals a stressful email that makes you anxious all night, corrupting sleep and time with your loved ones.
- One phrase said in the heat of anger turns into hours repairing a relationship.
- "Just one more drink" turns into a night of drinking, sleeping late, a hangover, and a wasted next day.

If you'd only turned down the drink, not opened Instagram, took a breath before responding... everything changes.

TODO no situation you can't make worse

### The Danger Of Unchecked Assumptions
My experiment rested on two assumptions:

1. **I could rely on my eyesight to determine if I was stepping in a safe place.** This relied on an incorrect belief about the way glass shatters. Namely, about how small shards could be.
2. **I'd immediately feel stepping on a shard.** This relied on an incorrect belief about the experience of stepping on a shard, and was supported by the belief about how small shards could be.

Reflecting, this belief about how small shards could be was driven by experience. I don't remember seeing such tiny glass before as a kid.






### Technology Is Leverage
My choice to go barefoot was anti-leverage. Making the small choice to wear shoes. 


### 










- Not going to not wear shoes
- Decided to try to clean up barefoot, carefully stepping
- Use any pain to detect broken glass
- This worked! Sort of...
-
