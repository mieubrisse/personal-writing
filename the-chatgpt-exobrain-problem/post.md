Four weeks ago I published [Building Your Exobrain 1: Customizing ChatGPT](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/building-your-exobrain-1-customizing). I promised to deliver the next part a week later. I still haven't done that.

What happened?

One week was just life stuff: travelling and not focusing on writing.

But the other three weeks were loss of motivation... feeling like I'm recommending something I'm losing faith in.

In exobrains?

Not at all. It's even more clear to me that exobrains _are_ the future.

I've been losing faith in ChatGPT as an exobrain implementation.

Since I started writing the upcoming post I've experienced...

- ChatGPT repeatedly telling me it will "update" a Canvas.. only to have it create a new one
- The "Edit Message" feature disappearing about 50% of the time in my conversations
- An 8-minute voice message to ChatGPT refusing to send, quoting an opaque `NSPosixError, 40`
- The two-choices "I prefer this response" dialog frequently picking the _opposite_ of what I select
- Searching for a way to give feedback and really struggling to find one
- Finding [the model feedback form](https://openai.com/form/model-behavior-feedback/), taking the time to record a Loom video... and nobody watching it or replying
- ChatGPT hallucinating the memories it has about me
- ChatGPT hallucinating that it's removed memories, even getting the "Memory Updated" dialog when it's not actually removed
- A Kafkaesque experience where the chat widget on [the OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/) tells me that I need to open the chat widget to report a bug... without ever actually reporting the bug
- [Pinging OpenAI on Twitter about the hallucination issue, to no response](https://x.com/kevinjtoday/status/1922718592321081596)
- Filing via the model feedback form again (again, no response)
- Signing up to OpenAI's BugCrowd and [filing the hallucination issue](https://bugcrowd.com/submissions/8ca74ca9-e48b-4aa9-806c-85d6ce81c26d), just to have the ticket closed as "This is for security bugs only"
- Even pinging a ChatGPT product manager on Linkedin to try and report (no response)

It shouldn't be this hard. This is Product 101 stuff: let your users report bugs.

On top of this, there are some glaringly obvious features still unimplemented:

- Editing memories
- Seeing the full scope of what's changed when clicking "Memory Updated" (it's nearly always cut off)
- Sort the conversation list by date
- Push notifications (apparently these work on phone, but still don't exist on Mac app)
- MCP support
- Allow choosing a model in subprojects

I'm coming to the conclusion that OpenAI doesn't have the product development skills to make it worth locking your exobrain into their ecosystem.

And from the rumor I've been hearing, they're more interested in being a model provider than a product maintainer of ChatGPT.

As such, I've started looking elsewhere. 

And... I'm concluding that the right tool hasn't been built yet.

Current tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini treat memory like a bonus, rather than the _core_ of the system. This makes sense: they need to be flexible enough to handle summarizing, roleplaying, brainstorming, 

But an exobrain is _all about_ memory.

An exobrain is guardrails. It's firm enough to keep you on track, but flexible enough to 

The heart of the exobrain is the context it has about you: where you want to go, and 

A functioning exobrain needs to be able to provide you two-way feedback (you ask i
