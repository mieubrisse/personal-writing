Narcissistic Tendencies, From The Inside
========================================
An exploration of 

![](./images/image.png)

My life has been characterized by strong emotions.

If I felt someone had done something unjust to me, it _ate_ at me like this gnawing plague. How _could_ they?

If I was angry, I obsessed over it - revisiting the cause of my anger, conscious that it was making me angrier still but drawn to the memory like a moth to a flame.

Sometimes well-meaning friends would tell me, "Just let it go, man"

It felt impossible.

To my therapist I once likened it to having a demon on my back, that would sometimes grab hold of me and yank me around.

I knew that others didn't seem to have as much difficulty. In group situations, unexpected setbacks seemed to bother and stick with me more than it did others.

I sometimes felt cursed. Wondering if I'd ever be free.

My first breakthrough came in February of last year, as I realized that the people in my family feel unsafe.

My sister, my parents, my grandparents... nobody's a happy person, smilingly good with life.

Investigating further, I noticed a trend in my direct family unit: when we feel unsafe, we attack back as a way to get the world to get off our back.

I told my cofounder about these discoveries.

A month later he told me he'd read a book called "The New Science of Narcissism", and suggested I might be a match for a type of narcissism called "covert narcissism".

Intrigued, I took [a narcissism test from OpenPsychometrics](TODO) and scored an 18 out of 40. Not overwhelming, but in the 73rd percentile (the average adult is supposedly 15.3).

I read the book. He was right; there was resonance.

Covert narcissism is characterized by a "wounded sense of self". It tends to present as hypersensitivity, low self-esteem, anxiety, insecurity, defensiveness, and victimization.

On my best days, this wasn't me. I could be very open to feedback, calm, and secure.

But on my worst days, this was absolutely me. Anxious, fearful, feeling bad about myself, feeling victimized.

I.e., when the demon had grabbed hold of me.

As I mulled this over, I started to plug in other things I'd recognized over the years.

- Neil Strauss' "The Truth" discusses "reactionary grandiosity", where someone feels bad about themselves so they go far the other way and try to garb themselves in superiority. I recognized this in myself when I'd judge myself as superior to others for being smarter, more financially responsible, or more morally pure.
- The Transactional Analysis school of psychology talks about the target mindstate that we're shooting for: "I'm Okay, You're Okay" It's contrasted with the various dysfunctional mindstates, "I'm Okay, You're Not Okay" (judgment/superiority), "I'm Not Okay, You're Okay" (inferiority, worthlessness), and "I'm Not Okay, You're Not Okay" (pure chaos).
- I'd known for years that [I have an intense Critical Voice](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/the-positive-voice) in my head, and I've worked over the years to turn down its volume and build up a Positive Voice in its place.

The covert narcissism thing _made sense_.

"The New Science Of Narcissism" seems written for people with someone in their life who has narcissistc tendencies. The advice seemed to be "People with narcissistic tendencies are destructive and can't change; get away."

For the audience, this probably makes sense. Narcissism is notoriously hard to treat because the person with narcissism can't face their imperfections, so therapy doesn't work.

And it was with this logic that my cofounder fired me, saying that "people with this take years to heal, if at all".

But for me - someone with narcissistic tendencies who recognizes it and wants to heal - I found the book lacking empathy.

I didn't ask for the demon. I don't want to be reactive. I want to feel light, happy, and free.

So I went looking further. 





Realizing that my family has the "unsafe"

Galen giving me the "covert narcissism" feedback

Galen firing me - "people take years to change, if they change at all"

What _is_ narcissism?

Covert narcissism - wounded sense of self

Narcissism forms a cycle

As a child, I didn't feel heard - lots of pressure, lots of criticism

Felt like I had to _fight_ to be heard, to be taken seriously

One of the ways I defended myself was stamp-collecting: collecting grievances and excuses, so that I could use them as defenses if my parents yelled at me.
- This is professionalizing making myself a victim!!

I later learned about the "Okay" mindsets of transactional analysis

You learn that you're not good enough, you're Not Okay

Develop a strong Critical Voice that repeats the same thing you've learned

So you feel like you have this void inside of you that sucks away all the positive stuff

Reactive grandiosity: trying hard to feel good about yourself!

The world is a constant

This resonates with Carol Dweck's "fixed mindset": intelligence and goodness is _fixed_, and everything you do is a test

My narcissism test came back as higher than normal

- "Do you think you're extraordinary?"
    - Well yes... my intelligence tests came back!

Only when I started exploring Dweck's growth mindset - intelligence can be trained! - did I realize that... if intelligence can be trained, then using "I'm smart" to mean "I'm extraordinary" is the same as saying "I'm a good snowboarder so I'm extraordinary". Sure you've done a ton of training, but that doesn't mean you're a more superior human.

So if our passage through life means we're just picking up skills, and maybe my ability to reason with complex problems is just one. Everybody has other distributions

I've known I have hypochondriac tendencies. Out of curiosity last night, I looked up if there's an association between the two. It's unclear, but for narcissists who are hypochondriacs, 

This felt VERY resonant:

> Hypochondriacs, Albarracin argues, are not looking for a cure to their ailment, but rather a witness to their suffering. They are missing an internalized good mother who is concerned for the child's symptoms and expresses empathy for their pain. They go from doctor to doctor desperately seeking an omnipotent professional able to sort out all the disappointments of earlier doctors. But the inevitable disappointment of the idealized doctor results in criticizing his/her incompetence, making the doctor less sympathetic to their pain. Often the patient's perpetual dissatisfaction alienates spouses, friends, and relatives as well, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And notice: "missing an internal good mother". Same thing - missing an intern

Regardless of how this came about... it's _my_ responsibility!!

Not defending myself here, even though I don't think Galen's accusation was fair
