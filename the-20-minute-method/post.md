title: "The 20 Minute Method"
---

_Written on 2024-10-05_

After years of experimenting on myself, I've developed a framework for getting good at things that I call the "20 Minute Method". It goes like this:

1. I must spend **at least** 20 minutes per day doing the thing I want to get good at.
2. If I do my 20 minutes, I get to feel good about myself. What I did doesn't matter, the quality of the practice doesn't matter. Only that I did my 20 minutes.
3. If I miss a day, I don't try to make it up. I just accept that I didn't put in my practice and my progress will be a bit slower.

That's it. But there's very intentional psychology behind it.

Mark Manson has a story about [a prolific novelist whose secret is "200 crappy words per day"](TODO), and last month I saw [a Farnam Street post](TODO) saying, 

> You don't need more intensity; you need more consistency. Intensity impresses, consistency transforms.

These align with what I've come to suspect: **time is the most important factor in skill development**.

Our culture today is all about flash & instant gratification. We get bombarded with news of cryptocurrency speculators who made millions in a month, Lamborghinis, beautiful houses, a barrage of insanely skilled performances on Youtube and the TV, Wall Street, plastic surgery, world-class meals made in half an hour.

We've become accustomed to results Right Now. 

But as any investor knows, time is your ally.

Let's say you want to double your money. The American stock market market tends to average ~6% annually. If you're willing to be patient, you can double your money with little effort or risk in 12 years (because `1.06 ^ 12 = 2.01`). Just buy the S&P500 and wait.

But if you need to do so quickly, things get way complicated. The best financial firms in the world are doing 30-40% annual returns, and there are big questions about whether those returns are sustainable indefinitely (during market crashes, on a 10+ year timespan, etc.). 

Meaning, if you want to double your money without relying on blind luck, the very fastest you could do so is ~2 years (because `1.4 ^ 2` is almost equal to 2). This also presupposes you get access to these elite funds; they don't give access to average people like you and me.

So even if you're using the very best in the world (who, again, may not be long-term sustainable), **you still need to be patient**.

The same goes for skill development. 

When I used to put all this pressure on myself to get very good at something very quickly, I was dedicating multiple hours per week to it. For physical skills like running or martial arts I'd make quick progress... then I'd get injured and my progress would get set back months. For every skill, I'd eventually get burnt out, start to dread practice, and quit.

I now believe such intensity is unnecessary and counterproductive. If I merely get 1% better each practice and keep showing up every day, in a year's time I'll be at 365% of where I started (for the math nerds, I used linear rather than exponential scaling because I don't think skill development works like compound interest).

Getting 1% better in a practice session is very easy: my natural desire to experiment and challenge myself, plus the learning function of my mind, ensures that.

The most important factor, therefore, is that I keep showing up to practice. 

All of the 20 Minute Method's stipulations are designed to take the pressure _off_, so that it's as easy as possible to show up to practice:

- Practice is only 20 minutes, because it's easy to find 20-minute blocks in a day but 30-minute blocks feel like a Whole Thing to schedule.
- What I do in practice doesn't matter, because when I feel I have to grind through a specific thing then practice starts to feel more like work and I dread showing up.
- If I miss a day, I don't force myself to make it up to ensure I don't create resistance for the next practice.
- I'm not obligated to do any more than 20 minutes, which is pressure relief on those inevitable days where I don't feel like practicing.

If you'd told me of this method 5 years ago, I would have assumed that all this pressure-easing would result in me doing the bare minimum. Yet, that's not what happens.

Because practice feels light and easy, I consistently show up. On the days when I'm excited to practice, I often go over the 20 minutes. On the days when I really don't feel like practicing, I say to myself, "It's only 20 minutes; it'll be over in no time."

And... _even on those days when I don't feel like practicing_ I frequently practice for more than the 20 minutes. The first 10-15 minutes feel rough, but ~70% of the time I get into the groove, start enjoying the practice, and continue beyond the timer.

I believe this is because the other 30% of the time (where I feel, "Thank God 20 minutes is up"), I give myself permission to stop right on the timer and feel good about it. Because I have the freedom to stop at 20 minutes, I don't feel trapped so my natural enjoyment of practicing gets space to bloom and take over.

As a result of the 20 Minute Method, I end up putting _at least_ ~120 hours of work per year into a thing. The equivalent of 3 x 40-hour workweeks. And because I give myself the freedom to keep going when the mood strikes, I'd guess it looks more like 170+ hours (estimating 60% of the time I just do 20 minutes, and 40% of the time I do 40+ minutes).

This has proven very effective for me, and hopefully it helps you too!

My results: 

- [This is ~9 months of progress learning guitar using the 20 Minute Method](TODO)
- [This is me climbing a V5 bouldering route, after ~22 months of climbing using a modified version of the 20 Minute Method](TODO) (see footnote)
- I decided to apply the 20 Minute Method to my writing 15 days ago. At the time, my blog had 15 posts, made over the 3 years of its existence. It now has 20 posts, including this one. I.e., 25% of my blog's content has been produced within the past 15 days (and I even missed two days!).
- I started applying the 20 Minute Method to exercise in February (with no restrictions on what exercise I did), and my bench press has gone from roughly 80kg to 95kg last week (obligatory disclaimer: while the 20 Minute Method definitely made me consistent, I also stopped working in March so I had more time to stay in the gym).

_Footnote: for skills whose practice can't be done daily for logistical or recovery reasons (e.g. rock climbing, kitesurfing, skydiving), I instead switch to "I must show up at least once a week. It doesn't matter for how long, it doesn't matter what practice I do; I just have to show up." What's happened historically: I end up rock-climbing 1-2 times per week, for 2-3 hours per session based on how I feel. I sometimes find myself impatient and wanting to go 2-3 times per week, but then I remind myself, "You need consistency, not intensity."_
