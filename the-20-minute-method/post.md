title: "The 20 Minute Method"
---

_Written on 2024-10-05_

After years of experimenting on myself, I've developed a framework for getting good at things that I call the "20 Minute Method". It goes like this:

1. I must spend **at least** 20 minutes per day doing the thing I want to get good at.
2. If I do my 20 minutes, I get to feel good about myself. What I did doesn't matter, the quality of the practice doesn't matter. Only that I did my 20 minutes.
3. If I miss a day, I don't try to make it up. I just accept that I didn't put in my practice and my progress will be a bit slower.

That's it. But there's some very intentional psychology behind it.

Mark Manson has a story about [a prolific novelist who writes "200 crappy words per day"](TODO), and last month I saw [a Farnam Street post](TODO) saying, 

> You don't need more intensity; you need more consistency. Intensity impresses, consistency transforms.

These seem to confirm what I've come to suspect: **time is the most important factor in skill development**.

Our culture today is all about flash & instant gratification. We get bombarded with news of cryptocurrency speculators who made millions in a month, Lamborghinis, beautiful houses, a cavalcade of insanely talented performances on Youtube or the Olympics, Wall Street, plastic surgery, world-class meals made in half an hour.

We want the results Right Now. 

But as any investor knows, time is your ally.

Let's say you want to double your money. The American stock market market averages ~6% annually. If you're willing to be patient, you can double your money with little effort or risk in 12 years (because `1.06 ^ 12 = 2.01`). Just buy the S&P500 and wait.

But if you need to do so quickly, things get way complicated. The best financial firms in the world are doing 30-40% annual returns, and there are big questions about whether those returns are sustainable indefinitely (during market crashes, on a 10+ year timespan, etc.). 

Meaning, if you want to double your money reliably, the very fastest you could do so is ~2 years (because `1.4 ^ 2` is almost equal to 2). This also presupposes you get access to these elite funds; they don't give access to average Joe's like you and me.

So even if you're using the very best in the world (who, again, may not be long-term sustainable), **you still have to wait 2 years**.

The same goes for skill development. 

When I used to put all this pressure on myself to get very good at something very quickly, I was trying to dedicate several hours per week to it. For physical skills like running or martial arts I'd make quick progress, then I'd get injured and my progress would get set back months. For every skill, I'd eventually get burnt out, start to dread practice, and quit.

I now believe such intensity is unnecessary and counterproductive. If I merely get 1% better per day and keep showing up every day, in a year's time I'll be at 365% of where I started (for the math nerds, I used linear rather than exponential scaling because I don't think skill development works like compound interest).

Getting 1% better in a practice session is very easy: my natural desires to experiment and challenge myself, plus the learning function of my mind, will handle that. 

The most important factor, therefore, is that I keep showing up to practice. 

All of the 20 Minute Method's stipulations are designed to take the pressure _off_, so that it's as easy as possible to show up to practice:

- Practice is only 20 minutes, because it's easy to find 20-minute blocks in a day but once it's 30 minutes then it feels like a Whole Thing to schedule.
- What I do in practice isn't important, because when I feel I have to grind through a specific thing then practice starts to feel more like work and I dread showing up.
- If I miss a day, I don't force myself to make it up to ensure the next practice doesn't feel heavy.
- I'm not obligated to do any more than 20 minutes, which is pressure relief on those days (which inevitably come) where I don't feel like practicing. I tell myself, "It's only 20 minutes."

If you'd told me of this method 5 years ago, I would have assumed that all this pressure easing would result in me doing the bare minimum. Yet, that's not what happens.

Because practice feels light and easy, I consistently show up. On the days when I'm feeling excited to practice, I often go over the 20 minutes time permitting. On the days when I really don't feel like practicing, I say to myself, "It's only 20 minutes; it'll be over in no time."

And... _even on those days_ I frequently practice for more than the 20 minutes. The first 10-15 minutes feel rough, but ~70% of the time I get into the groove and end up continuing beyond the timer.

I believe this is because the other 30% of the time (where I feel "thank God 20 minutes is up"), I stop right on the timer and I let myself feel good about it. Because I give myself the freedom to stop at 20 minutes, I don't build resentment to overpower the enjoyment of practicing that eventually arrives.

As a result of the 20 Minute Method, I end up putting _at least_ ~120 hours of work per year into a thing. The equivalent of 3 40-hour workweeks. And because I give myself the freedom to keep going when the mood strikes, I'd guess it looks more like 170+ hours (estimating 60% of the time I just do 20 minutes, and 40% of the time I do 40+ minutes).

The results: 
- [This is ~9 months of learning guitar using the 20 Minute Method](TODO)
- I decided to apply the 20 Minute Method to my writing 15 days ago. At the time, my blog had 15 posts, made over the 3 years of its existence. It now has 20 posts, including this one. 25% of my blog's content has been produced within the past 15 days (and I even missed two days!).

- I started applying the 20 Minute Method to exercise in February (with no restrictions on what exercise I did), and I've been the most consistent with weightlifting I've ever been (

















**Interesting bit of psychology #1:** I've found resistance to practice to be front-loaded. On the days when I don't feel excited to practice, I'll start with the intent of just grinding out my 20 minutes. Once I get 10-15 minutes in though, I start to find my groove. When the 20 minutes hits, there's a ~70% chance I won't want to stop.

This is why practice is _at least_ 20 minutes: you want to give yourself the option, but not the obligation, to capture those extra moments beyond 20 minutes.

The other 30% of the time, I feel "thank God practice is over". That's okay too; I put in my 20 minutes and that means I get to mark it as a win.

**Interesting bit of psychology #2:** The more I consistently practice, the more excited I find myself to be for practicing. I suspect this has to do with innate human resistance to the unknown

In Malcolm Gladwell's "Outliers", he finds that becoming world class at any skill takes roughly 10,000 hours of practice. Most people picking up a skill aren't trying to be world-class - they want to do the thing, enjoy it, and get reasonably good at it - so let's say that 50% of world class would be Very Impressive in the everyday world. Even being half as good as Lebron James or Tiger Woods or Gordon Ramsay (which costs 5,000 hours) is plenty.

So if you've never done a skill before,

Let's say you're at a 0-out-of-10 good at your desired skill. If you want to get to a 1 (10% of elite level), you have to put in 1,000 hours.
