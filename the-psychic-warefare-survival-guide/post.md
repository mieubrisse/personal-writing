Why this guide?
--------------
The internet is wonderful. It's democratized knowledge, enabled global communities, and birthed fantastic innovations.

The internet is also horrible. Hundreds of aggressive corporations work tirelessly to capture our attention and distract us with tangents that benefit their profits.

Watching a tutorial? An attention-grabbing video you didn't choose autoplays at the end.

Googling something? The first five results are ad-infested, SEO-optimized garbage.

Searching for something on Instagram? The search bar is 5% of the screen, while 95% is visually-enticing distractions.

No wonder the modern internet leaves us exhausted and anxious. We're being hunted everywhere we go.

This has become normalized.

As if our mental health is the price we must pay to access the riches the internet has on offer.

Sucking away years of our potential to serve someone else's engagement metrics.

I'm sick of this devil's bargain. I bet you are too.

This post is a defense guide for the modern mental battlefield.

The Strategy
------------
You intrinsically know what's good vs bad on the internet.

The good parts serve you. They're hard at first, and help you become the person you want to be - health, education, career advancement, financial planning. You'd feel proud being addicted to them.

The bad parts keep you from becoming the person you want to be. They feel easy at first: memes, impulse shopping, social media, online games, pornography. You feel guilty being addicted to these.

The companies providing the bad stuff know you innately seek the good and flee the bad. 

They have to leverage potent psychology and tech to make their products as addicting as possible.

This guide gives you psych and tech defenses of your own.

Part 1 focuses on your psych defenses, while Part 2 focuses on tech.

Understanding Your Psychic Vulnerability
----------------------------------------
To guard ourselves, we first need to understand our vulnerability:

The modern world is crazy.

It's highly complex, moves rapidly, never switches off, and has more things than you could do in a lifetime.

The environment we evolved in was stupid simple by comparison, and modernity is exhausting.

When we're drained, we seek to relax with rest, comfort, entertainment, and connection with others.

Seeking relaxation in the physical world feels intrinsically fulfilling (it's what we evolved for, after all).

It's also constrained by natural laws.

A performer needs to rest. Your conversation partner gets tired. A recreational sport tires you out. Your stomach gets full.

Digital content does not have this constraint. Its cost to the provider is nearly zero.

If recharging online was fulfilling, you'd engage, feel recharged, unplug, and go on with your life.

But then you'd leave the site. Meaning, the provider would no longer make money off you.

So the incentive is to provide us with enough "recharging" that you reach for the site when you're feeling drained, but not enough that we recharge and leave.

And lo, autoplay and infinite scroll and "More Content You Might Like" and slot machine-like "What's going to come up next when I swipe?"

Our vulnerability is thus:

We get drained by modern life, and then willingly expose our drained, vulnerable self to corporations incentivized to feed us "empty calories".

No Solo Internet Entertainment
------------------------------
To protect ourselves, we must first understand that we're seeking something when we go online to recharge.

Alcoholics Anonymous has a great acronym, **HALT**:

When someone craves a drink, they should first ask themselves if they're **H**ungry, **A**ngry, **L**onely, or **T**ired.

I.e., first find out how they're drained.

Then they should address the actual need, because alcohol helps none of those.

When try to recharge with Instagram, Netflix, Reddit, or Pornhub, we're doing the same thing as an alcoholic: trying to meet a need with something that can't fill the need (a topic I've [written about before](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/the-positive-voice?utm_source=publication-search#:~:text=Now%2C%20at%20the,of%20negative%20emotions.)).

We must first HALT and ask ourselves, "What am I needing?" so we can address the underlying need.

But this is not enough. An alcoholic who tries to quit drinking must remove alcohol from the house else they _will_ relapse.

I propose the same: **no solo entertainment**.




The ideal would be if you can 

However, I've found

### Chrome Extensions
A good chunk of these extensions come from [nintracker's Reddit guide for keeping Chrome distraction-free][nintrader-chrome-guide]; big thanks to him for such great extension recommendations.

_NOTE: All these extensions will need to have "Allow in incognito mode" enabled in their extension options_

- [AdBlock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adblock-%E2%80%94-block-ads-acros/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom/reviews) - Adblocker #1
- [Adblock Plus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) - Adblocker #2
- [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) - Adblocker #3
    - Supposedly this extension is getting killed because of Google-friendly changes Chrome is making, and [uBlock Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh) is a sort-of-replacement. uBlock Origin is still working for me though, so your mileage may vary
    - It can also be used to block sections of a website that suck but don't have a Chrome extension to remove (e.g. I used it to remove StackOverflow's "Hot Network Questions" section) by right-clicking and selecting "Block this element..."
- [Privacy Badger](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp) - Automatically opt out of data sharing & selling, and block sites who don't obey
- [Web Site Blocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-site-blocker/aoabjfoanlljmgnohepbkimcekolejjn) - Allow sites only during certain times
    - I use this to block sites with high distraction potential after 8:30pm as part of my wind-down ritual before bed (more info on bedtime rituals in [my sleep guide][sleep-guide])
    - The sites I block are Youtube, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook
- [Website Blocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/website-blocker/kniediipngcpmbmpeacaoinhoeipfina) - Flat block sites and URL patterns
    - I use this to block sites that I never want to access: Twitch TV, r/all, pornography, etc.
- [Antigram](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/antigram-explore-reels-bl/igbheapdmolhhmmklmkfjjjncmhihfjh) - Blocks distracting Instagram features
    - Unfortunately it can't turn off the feed, which I find very distracting and don't like
- [Behind The Overlay](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/behind-the-overlay/ljipkdpcjbmhkdjjmbbaggebcednbbme/reviews) - Provides a button to remove popovers from sites
    - NOTE: I use this for killing terrible "Subscribe to my newsletter!" popups; I try to avoid it for killing paywalls because it seems fair to me that someone wants to get paid for their work producing a high-quality article
- [BlockTube](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blocktube/bbeaicapbccfllodepmimpkgecanonai) - Block various distracting features of Youtube
    - I use this to block "Explore" and "Shorts", as well as various entertainment channels
    - This allows me to still leave educational and work-related videos available
- [Clickbait Remover for Youtube](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clickbait-remover-for-you/omoinegiohhgbikclijaniebjpkeopip) - Removes clickbait thumbnails and replaces **ATTENTION-GRABBING TITLES!!** with **Normal titles**
- [Distraction Free for Youtube](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna) - Allows removing more Youtube distracting features
    - I use it to turn off the Feed, autoplay, Related Videos at the end of the video, the "Trending" tab, and the sidebar with "Recommended videos"
- [I still don't care about cookies](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/i-still-dont-care-about-c/edibdbjcniadpccecjdfdjjppcpchdlm) - Removes the "This site uses cookies" popup
    - NOTE: **don't** use the similarly-named "I don't care about cookies" extension; it was bought by a shady company and is likely selling your data
- [Cookie AutoDelete](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-autodelete/fhcgjolkccmbidfldomjliifgaodjagh/reviews) - "I still don't care about cookies" allows storing cookies, and this cleans them up as soon as I close the tab
    - NOTE: This does require whitelisting sites that I want to stay logged in for
- [Don't fuck with paste](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dont-f-with-paste/nkgllhigpcljnhoakjkgaieabnkmgdkb) - Don't allow sites to block paste
    - Not technically a "block distractions" extension, but one that makes the internet significantly less annoying when sites try to block paste
- [Ecosia](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ecosia-the-search-engine/eedlgdlajadkbbjoobobefphmfkcchfk) - Switches my search engine to [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/), a German nonprofit that uses its income to plant trees
    - I got motivated to switch because Google's search became a toxic wasteland of ads and SEO trash
    - I tried and liked DuckDuckGo, but figured planting trees was even better still
- [JustRead](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/just-read/dgmanlpmmkibanfdgjocnabmcaclkmod) - Purifies popup-infested news sites into simple text and images
    - My site list comes from [nintrader's guide][nintrader-chrome-guide]

### Mac
- [Lookaway](https://lookaway.app/) - Reminds me to take periodic eye breaks, helping to prevent [nearwork-induced myopia](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9820324/#sec5-ijerph-20-00875)

    - It plays ads occasionally, but the functionality is so good that I put up with it; might pay them because I've been getting good value from its free tier

### Misc
- **Gmail 'Unsubscribe'** - A brute-force unsubscribe
    - I used to click the "Unsubscribe" link every time I got added to an unwanted newsletter, but sites always seemed to "forget" or create a new newsletter to get around it
    - Plus, [that unsubscribe link is a security risk](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blocksite-block-websites/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh)
    - Now I just nuke the site with Gmail's built-in "Unsubscribe" at the top of the email chain, and add an `Unsubscribed` label so that if they send me an email later I can know that they didn't respect my unsubscribe and mark them as spam









Understanding Your Psychic Vulnerability
--------------------------
To guard ourselves, we first need to understand our vulnerability:

The modern world is crazy.

It's highly complex, moves rapidly, never switches off, and has more things than you could do in a lifetime.

The environment we evolved in was stupid simple by comparison, and modernity is exhausting.

When a human is drained, they seek to relax with rest, comfort, entertainment, and connection with others.

Seeking relaxation in the physical world feels intrinsically fulfilling (it's what we evolved for, after all), and is constrained by natural laws.

A performer needs to rest. Your conversation partner gets tired. A recreational sport tires you out. Your stomach gets full.

Digital content does not have this constraint. Its cost to the provider is nearly zero.

If recharging online was fulfilling, you'd engage, feel recharged, unplug, and go on with your life.

But then you'd leave the site. Meaning, the provider would no longer make money off you.

So the incentive is to provide us with enough "recharging" that you reach for the site when you're feeling drained, but not enough that we recharge and leave.

And lo, autoplay and infinite scroll and "More Content You Might Like" and slot machine-like "What's going to come up next when I swipe?"

Our vulnerability is thus:

We get drained by modern life, and then willingly expose our drained, vulnerable self to companies incentivized to feed us "empty calories".


### The good parts
You know these instinctively: they align with who you want to become, and move your life forward.

They usually feel hard and tiring upfront, but yield longterm results: health, education, career work, financial planning, etc.

The companies providing these things offer something valuable to you, and charge for it with transparent pricing.

For example, your bank doesn't need to manipulate you because it (hopefully) helps you become a more financially responsible person.

### The bad parts
You also know these instinctively: they pose the risk of addiction, or make you feel guilty afterwards

Memes, impulse shopping, social media, online games, pornography, etc.

The companies providing these things know they hinder you from becoming the person you want to be.

So they leverage the powers of tech and psychology to make their products as addicting as possible. They must, because you won't naturally come back.

### Our strategy
Therefore, we will use the power of psychology and tech ot 

The Tactics
-----------






Your online bank 





Understand that you are seeking something

To understand your vulnerability on the modern battlefield, you must understand that you 


But when we use the internet to recharge, we arrive on the battlefield with our most vulnerable, least-defended selves.

Meaning, those same aggressive companies will happily offer something that _seems_ like recharging...

...but they have an incentive not to actually recharge you, because if you recharge you leave their site and do something else.

Real-world recharging is constrained by physical laws, and must naturally end.

The near-zero marginal cost of digital entertainment means they're incentivized to offer you more entertainment "empty calories"


put our least-guarded selves into contact with the never-sleeping technology of companies seeking to capitalize on our exhaustion.

The near-zero marginal cost of providing digital entertainment means that a digital entertainment company has an incentive to keep you consuming. It costs them next to nothing, and 


Digital entertainment has near-zero marginal cost to an entertainment company, so they're incentivized to keep you coming back (and making purchases).



TODO something about how the corporations will present themselves as adorable (because it's terrifying to see how hard they work to hijack your psychology so you do what they want)
- Websites feel banal, comfortable, familiar
- But the stakes are your time, mental space, health, even beliefs themselves - i.e., your life, and the very core of your being
- You should treat interacting with Facebook, Twitter, etc. as a starving dog! Don't turn your back on it!
- They are hungry ghosts!!


The complex modern world exhausts us.

The complex modern world exhausts us. We recharge with relaxation, entertainment, comfort, connection with other humans.

This is healthy when found outside a screen.

But when we go to a screen seeking these, we arrive at 






My therapist taught me that addictions always have an emotional component.



Over the years I've found internet entertainment to be "empty calories", leaving me unfulfilled and always craving more (which the internet helpfully serves). As such, it's better for me to get my entertainment outside a screen.

I feel 

### Be ruthless

These companies try hard to hijack your psychology so you can spend more time, attention, and money on their sites. I.e., so you can serve them. Use the power of technology to defend yourself, and make them serve you.

### Support honest business
There are plenty of honest companies trying to provide high-quality goods at a fair price. If we don't support the honest companies, the manipulative companies will win because they have a competitive advantage. Therefore, support the companies that provide goods & services you like.

- Fuck popups
- Fuck listicles and "7 things" stupid shit

- Fuck slot-machine effects
- Fuck inline ads, your banner ads, all your ads
- Fuck politics, ragebait, and things I can't control
- Fuck pornography
- Fuck email lists I didn't subscribe to, or that "forget" my unsubscribe
