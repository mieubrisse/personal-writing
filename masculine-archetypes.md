Masculine Archetypes
====================
_Written 2021-08-14_
This essay explores my journey of discovering and thinking about masculine archetypes.

Rugged, Refined, Rakish
-----------------------
I was first introduced to the idea of masculine archetypes while my friend [Galen](https://twitter.com/galenmarchetti) kk



* First started hearing about RRR
    * This felt good - felt like it was describing something that I felt
    * But, also felt like it was missing _something_
    * E.g. describiing hipsters and hippies as Rakes felt overly-broad
    * I didn't really understand Refined
    * Underlying feeling I had was that it was missing some dimensions

Warrior, Lover, Magician, King
------------------------------
* Heard about WLMK from Shae Matthews
    * Really resonated with me - felt intuitively more descriptive than RRR
    * Matched my own life:
        * The Magician came online first
        * Then the Lover
        * Then the Warrior
        * Finally the King
* Read WLMK
    * Really resonated with the archetypes, in particular:
        * King, as generative & lawgiver
        * I saw the Addicted Lover inside myself
    * Still felt like it was missing something - e.g. where does the Outlaw fit in into the archetypes?

Expanding To Full Archetypes
----------------------------
* Made my list of archetypes that I intuitively felt
