In [my last post](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/the-chatgpt-exobrain-problem) I talked about how I desperately want to build an [exobrain](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/you-need-an-exobrain), but ChatGPT and the like aren't cutting it. I also said that I'm exploring building something on my own.

In truth, I'd already been doing product research for the previous three weeks.

I'd gotten good signal, and I was (and am) excited to work a general-purpose exobrain product.

Only, there's a problem. 

I have severely nearsighted eyes. During childhood it seemed like my vision was constantly worse every time I went to the eye doctor, and in 2017 I had -9.0 in my left eye and -7.3 in my right.

That same year I got LASIK and had astounding vision for several years... until it started getting worse again in 2022.

I also started seeing flashes in my left eye.

Nearsightedness means your eyes are not a sphere but oblong, like an American football. With longer eyes, the retina gets stretched taut. Taut retinas are extra sensitive and create phantom flashes.

Stretch the retina too much and a hole is torn. With a hole, the gel in your eye can then get pushed behind the retina, and cause the retina to peel off the back of your eye like old wallpaper. This can cause blindness. 

Seeing flashes is A Huge Warning.

I was scared, so I visited a doctor. He told me, "You have really long eyes and your retinas are stretched, but there's no hole. Come back when you have a hole."

This seemed like a bad idea. There are surgeries to try and correct retinal tears, but they're highly invasive and not guaranteed. The eye seems to be an organ modern medicine isn't great at fixing.

Wasn't there anything I could do to to reverse the situation? After all, if my eyes could get longer... couldn't they get shorter?

The doctor gave me the same answer my childhood optometrist always told me: myopia's genetic, and the only thing you can do is get glasses.

I ended up visiting 7 different doctors across Brazil and US, and they all said the same thing. Stretched-but-not-torn retinas, nothing I can do except glasses, come back when there's a retinal tear.

I never took the doctors up on the glasses because two things kept niggling at my brain:

1. As a kid I noticed that each time I got more powerful glasses it seemed my vision would degrade from 100% crispness to 90% over 3-6 months and then stabilize there... until I got new glasses and the cycle repeated.
1. I once read about [a shocking study that nearsightedness in Inuits (Eskimos) was virtually nonexistent until the introduction of reading in the 1950's](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1956268/).



I asked my childhood optometrist if reading could cause myopia and he gave the same line: no, it's genetic, you need glasses.

kkkk

several things niggled at my brain:

In 2022 my vision started getting worew
