The Paradox Of (Feelings Of) Failure
==================================

![](./images/image.png)

An anxious part of my brain has recently been feeding me feelings of failure.

It's consumed the news of the AI boom - the new movers-and-shakers of the world - and it points at me to say, "You're not doing any of this."

It sees my friends who've founded startups that are taking off and says, "[You got fired from your own startup](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/a-lifes-work)."

It sees the meteoric rise of $PLTR and mocks, "You sold at $38".

It sees excellent writers on Substack and says, "Your writing is mediocre; it is flat, boring, and unimpactful."

It sees inspired products and says, "What you build is plain, boring, and dumb."

The next urge comes from a primal place of fear. I must react _urgently_.

I _need_ to join an AI company, work a million hours on a startup, be jealous of my friends.

Thankfully, I've worked with some great people who've helped me become aware of these feelings and step outside of them.

Observe them, dispassionately.

This is good, because there's mental trickery at play.

That anxious brain is amplifying the negative, and dampening the positive.

Its whispers chant, "You are not good enough. You are not good enough. You are not good enough."

It obsesses over the bad, and ignores the good.

And there _is_ good.

It discards the times when people tell me my writing resonated for them.

It ignores the recent [surge in popularity one of my tools got](TODO cmd HN?).

It forgets the friends who tell me what I'm working on is intriguing and exciting.

It doesn't acknowledge that getting fired was one of the most transformative positive experiences of my life.

And, principally, it does not acknowledge the role of ownership.

Reality doesn't lie to you.

If you don't have what you want, it's because you haven't made it happen.

Setbacks are out of our control. Persistence is within it.

My actions led to my cofounder feeling like he needed to fire me.

My lack of experience in writing and product-building are why my projects don't have the traction I want.

I will fix all of these, but I need to _keep going_.

The SEALs and Green Berets who pass selection say that the people who think about the future quit, while those who concentrate on putting one foot in front of the other pass.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Then another. Then another.

_This_, my calm brain knows, is what success is actually made of.

The courage to feel like a failure and keep going.

I know this because I hear it over and over from successful people.

Farnam Street: "You don't need more intensity; you need more consistency. Intensity impresses; consistency transforms."

Naval Ravikant: "Eventually, you will get what you deserve. It won't happen on the timeframe you'd like, but it will happen."

The founder that [turned the same idea I had into a successful startup](https://projectionlab.com/blog/we-reached-1m-arr-with-zero-funding): "

TODO ProjectionLab, saying success indexes on conssitency

TODO FarnamStreet about consistency over intensity

_Everybody_ goes through that "What the fuck am I even doing?" when they're first starting out.

The way to get through it is to feel it, face it, accept it, and keep going regardless.

Because reality doesn't lie to you. If you haven't succeeded, it's because you don't yet deserve it.

And I _will_ deserve it. But I have to keep going, keep training.

This requires courage.

Courage _not_ to run to an AI startup, to not work to the point of burnout, to congratulate my friends for their good choices rather than being jealous.

This, I am convinced, is where success actually lives.

Taking one more step. One more photo.

That calm part of my brain knows that one day, when I have succeeded like I want, I will look back on this post with fondness: "Ah yes, I remember those times. They were difficult, but they were necessary."









I've been interested in perceiving these feelings: noticing that I'm feeling them, and then stepping outside of them to analyze.

What's happening? Why?

"Failure" must be some sort of psychological gap, between expectation and reality. I create a dream for myself of where we'll be, and then hold ourselves to reaching it.

When we don't, we feel failed.

Emotionally, this state feels punishing: a thousand questions of "Why?", seeing others who have "succeeded" and torturing oneself with the comparison.

But these are just feelings; they're not based in reality.

TODO there's nothing of value left to add in the world

TODO we're going through a seismic shift in the way the world works - building with AI

The reality, of course, is that it's all part of the plan.

_Everybody_ goes through those times

Yet, my brain down-emphasizes the positive:
- The people who tell me they like my writing; that it resonated with them
- The joy I get from building these projects
- The 

It gets lost in the fear that it's all worthless, it's not good enough.

_Not good enough._

That's what shows up. And that might be true. Is true. It's _not_ good enough.

Yet. (TODO link to the "yet" video?)

Because reality won't lie to you. If you haven't got what you think you deserve, it's because you're not making it happen.

There could be many reasons; it's not just "you're not working hard enough". Sometimes it's "you're not doing the right type of work".

Sometimes you just want to write code, but marketing is the answer.

"I'm working so hard, and not succeeding!"

You need to change your strategy.

Other times, you just need patience. Things are growing and expanding, but you need to be patient.

Success takes times.

Like the Alchemy founder told us, "It takes a lot longer than you think."

If you really want to solve the problem, you have to step back and evaluate, "What's going wrong? What do I need to change?"

I am impatient

My emotions want success _now_; they cry about why I don't have it

But the reality is, my actions aren't yet in alignment with what's needed for success

Not having the patience, the foresight

I hope this article will be a reminder to future me, who will have achieved more and built more,
