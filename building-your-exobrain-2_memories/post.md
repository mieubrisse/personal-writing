Last week we [started on the journey of building your exobrain in ChatGPT][customizing-chatgpt]:

- We identified your values, your personal board of directors, and context about where you are in life
- We loaded it into ChatGPT's "Customize ChatGPT" section
- We instructed ChatGPT on how to start acting as an exobrain
- We did a face-off of untrained ChatGPT vs my exobrain-trained ChatGPT

This week we further construct your exobrain with memories.

Memories
--------
Unlike the "Customize ChatGPT", memories are modifiable by ChatGPT itself.

Meaning, if configured right, they can be used so ChatGPT guides itself into serving you better.

First order of business: enable them if you haven't already. Go to `Settings > Personalization` and turn on `Reference Saved Memories` and `Reference Chat History`.

Unfortunately you only get ~150 memories. And earlier versions of ChatGPT had a tendency to remember _everything_ - including minimally-useful stuff.

Meaning, your memories might already be full of junk.

Ideally we want to use AI leverage to clean this for us. But be aware there's bugginess with how ChatGPT deletes memories, saying it's deleted them without actually deleting them. You can see an example of this behaviour [in this Twitter thread](https://x.com/kevinjtoday/status/1922718592321081596). 

The most surefire way to do this is via `Settings > Personalization > Manage Memories`, cleaning out memories that aren't high-value to you.

But if you want to try your luck with AI, open a new chat and try this prompt:

```
Your job is to keep my memory lean, sharp, and high-leverage.

I want you to review the memories you have saved for me with the following goals:

1. Preserve only high-signal memories â€” facts, patterns, principles, and identity-level truths that are either:
    -	Recurrently relevant to my decision-making
    -	Strong predictors of future behavior
    -	Helpful in calibrating advice to my goals, values, or constraints
2. Flag low-signal memories for potential deletion or combination with other memories, including:
    -	One-off events or facts that donâ€™t influence future choices
    -	Transient states (e.g., fleeting moods, situational anxieties) unless they reveal a pattern
    -	Micro-details that donâ€™t shape strategic behavior
    -	Redundant versions of already captured ideas
    -	Completed or expired intentions

Optimize for memories that will help you help me be more effective. If a memory only matters in a narrow or short-lived context, and wonâ€™t affect future decisions, it should likely be removed or condensed.

For each low-signal memory that you are recommending removal or combination, you must explain why you are making that recommendation.

Wait for confirmation from me before you actually modify memories.

Make sure you double-check that any memory modifications that result from our chat are actually applied, as I've seen in the past where you tell me a memory is forgotten/modified but it doesn't actually get forgotten/modified. It's your responsibility to ensure the proposed change actually takes place.

Now that we've cleaned your memories, 



First order of busines

But we 

- Benefit of memories is they're mutable by ChatGPT
    - Means you don't have to do this yourself
- BUT, can only hold ~150
    - Still not sure if this is by token count, or by memory number
- ChatGPT tendency (which has gotten better) to save useless stuff and fill up your memories
    - Prompts on how to clear out your memories
- Tell ChatGPT that you want it to periodically clear out your memories




Limitations
-----------
- Conversations getting memories not saved
