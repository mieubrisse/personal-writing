Last week we [started on the journey of building your exobrain in ChatGPT][customizing-chatgpt]:

- We identified your values, your personal board of directors, and context about where you are in life
- We loaded it into ChatGPT's "Personalize ChatGPT" section
- We instructed ChatGPT on how to start acting as an exobrain
- We did a comparison face-off of an untrained ChatGPT vs my exobrain-trained ChatGPT

This week we dive deeper with memories. We'll load your ChatGPT with exobrain-specific memories and teach you how to manage them.

Memories
--------
- Benefit of memories is they're mutable by ChatGPT
    - Means you don't have to do this yourself
- BUT, can only hold ~150
    - Still not sure if this is by token count, or by memory number
- ChatGPT tendency (which has gotten better) to save useless stuff and fill up your memories




Limitations
-----------
- Conversations getting memories not saved




Conclusion
----------
TODO Challenge/questions to the reader
