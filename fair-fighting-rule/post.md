Learning to control conflict

![](./images/image.png)

I hated interpersonal conflict growing up.

I felt like I was struggling to stay above water, thrashing to defend myself from sharks, while my brain slowed to molasses.

I'd come away feeling like I'd lost something, and only as I lay awake in bed would the thoughts come:

"Man, I forgot about `evidence_supporting_my_side`!"

Or "Damn, I should have said _that_ zinger!"

As a result, I began to avoid conflict. A natural reaction when conflict seemed to explode beyond my control.

I no longer feel this. Today I want to share a tool that changed everything.

Slowing it down
---------------
In 2021 I bought a course called [The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal][art-of-best-deal] by Seth Freeman.

What happens when you're in a heated argument? Yelling, right?

Prof Freeman teaches that people yell in arguments because they don't feel heard.

They subconsciously shout to try and break through to the other person. To get them to _listen_.

Freeman then introduces a tactic called "Fair Fighting". It goes like this:

1. In an argument, one person speaks and the other listens without interrupting.
1. When the speaker is done, the listener must summarize their understanding of what the speaker has said to the speaker's satisfaction before the listener responds. The listener is _not_ saying they agree! Simply that they understood.
1. The roles then swap as many times as necessary.

That's it.

Yet this thing is **magic**.

In the four years I've been practicing it, every argument where I've applied Fair Fighting has deescalated. Anger simply melts.

Turns out, feeling heard is _powerful_.

So powerful, in fact, that it can sustain large parts of a conversation.

A common psychotherapist strategy is summarizing: actively listening, then repeating back what you said to you.

"So it seems like you're saying that you're frustrated you're not getting the recognition you feel you deserve at work."

"Yeah! And I feel like it's not just me; there are whole departments..."

You don't even notice that the therapist hasn't added any new information to the conversation; you just keep going because you feel the other person is following along.

What's crazier: even knowing that psychotherapists do this intentionally, _you will still feel good about it_.

Perhaps, we recognize that the real value is in the effort the other person puts in. A way to say "I care about you enough to invest my time to understand what you're saying".

Which is what Fair Fighting is all about.

The repetition of your partner's point of view before you respond says, "I care enough about you to listen to what you're saying and summarize it, even if I don't agree with it."

Fight energy can't sustain itself in this atmosphere. It slows, then fizzles out.

Conclusion
----------
Fair Fighting was an epiphany for me.

I began to realize that I could keep interactions from getting out of control - and me from getting overwhelmed - simply by repeating what the other person was saying.

Even in volatile situations, I could exert control so long as I could control myself.

Now, Fair Fighting is _not_ a cure-all. I met people who'd consistently "forget" to summarize my points after I'd summarized theirs.

I later realized these people were silently telling me they don't value me. I distanced myself from them, and became happier.

Because someone who cares about you _will_ put in that effort.
