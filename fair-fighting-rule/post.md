Conflict Control Rods
=====================
Regaining stability when things are getting hot

![](./images/image.png)

I hated interpersonal conflict as a kid.

It felt like hugging a nuclear reactor gone critical: explosive and overwhelming, my brain turning to neon-green oatmeal in real time.

Only as I lay awake in bed that night would the thoughts tumble in:

"I forgot about `fact supporting what I was saying`!"

Or "Man, what he said was really unfair but I didn't realize it in the moment."

Or "Damn, I should have replied with _that_ zinger!"

I began to avoid conflict as a result. Only natural, when conflict seemed uncontrollable.

I no longer feel this way as a 34-year-old man.

Conflict is unpleasant, but I've learned how to control it.

Today I want to share an essential tool in my conflict control toolkit.

Slowing it down
---------------
In 2021 I bought a course called [The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal][art-of-best-deal] by Seth Freeman.

What happens when you're in a heated argument? Yelling, right?

Prof Freeman teaches that people yell in arguments because they don't feel heard.

They subconsciously shout to try and break through to the other person. To get them to _listen_.

Freeman then introduces a tactic called "fair fighting". It goes like this:

1. In an argument, one person speaks and the other listens without interrupting.
1. When the speaker is done, the listener must summarize their understanding of what the speaker has said to the speaker's satisfaction.
    - The listener is _not_ saying they agree! Simply that they understood.
    - This means the listener's summary elicits something like "Yes, that's right" from the speaker.
    - If the listener's summary didn't get it right, the speaker clarifies and the listener tries again until they get the "Yes, that's right".
1. The roles then swap as many times as necessary.

That's it. But turns out, feeling heard is _powerful_.

So powerful, in fact, that it can often sustain an entire conversation.

A common psychotherapist strategy is summarizing: actively listening, then repeating back to you what you said.

"It seems like you're saying you're frustrated because you're not getting the recognition you feel you deserve at work."

"Yeah! And I feel like it's not just me; there are whole departments..."

You don't even notice that the therapist hasn't added any new information to the conversation. You just keep going because you feel they're following along.

What's crazier: even knowing that psychotherapists do this _won't change how effective it is with you_.

Perhaps, we recognize that the real value is in the effort the other person puts in. A way to say "I care about you enough to invest my time to understand what you're saying".

That's what fair fighting is all about.

Summarizing your partner's point of view before you respond says, "I'm hearing you. I care enough to listen to what you're saying, even if I don't agree with it."

Fight energy can't sustain itself in this atmosphere. It slows, then fizzles out.

Fair fighting in practice
-------------------------
Last week I [wrote about my first fight with my girlfriend](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/the-relationship-gps).

I introduced the diagnostic tool I use to recognize when I'm tilted, and explained how it helped me identify where we needed to go.

Fair fighting was the other half of the puzzle.

If "I'm okay, you're okay" is the relationship GPS showing how lost you are, then fair fighting is the control rod to tame an overloading reactor into productive energy for getting you back on track.

So I called my girlfriend up, introduced the fair fighting concept, and asked if she was game to try it.

She agreed.

We then spent an hour taking turns, repeating our understanding of what the other said and then responding.

By the end of the hour we were laughing and liked each other once more.

We felt we'd gained a deeper understanding of each other, and (surprise) neither of us was a villain. We were just scared and feeling unheard.

These results are consistent with what I've gotten when practicing fair fighting in my previous relationships. It really does work.

But a tool must be wielded well to function, so here are some gotchas to look out for:

### Not using fair fighting
Conversations tend to escalate when we're in the heat of the moment.

We start responding quicker, we get more insistent, we start to interrupt.

When the reaction begins to overheat like this, we sometimes plain forget to slow things down.

To guard against this, my girlfriend and I agreed on a rule: anybody can invoke fair fighting any time they're not feeling heard.

However, the person who invokes it has to summarize first so that fair fighting isn't used as a weapon ("I'm feeling unheard; you have to summarize me!").

In this way, either of us can put in the control rods to keep our conversation from going crazy.

### One player monopolizing the conversation
The listener's summary will usually make the speaker feel heard.

Just like in therapy, the speaker has a tendency to go, "Yeah! And...." (launching into a second long paragraph)

This isn't fair for the listener: they got the summary right but don't get to say their piece.

It's important that the turn-taking stays at "Summarize until the speaker agrees, then swap" so that both parties get to speak and feel heard.

### One player refusing to summarize
In previous relationships (but thankfully not this one), some women would repeatedly forget/refuse to summarize me.

I'd summarize them to their satisfaction, but after I said my piece they'd jump right into their side again.

I used to be patient, reminding them over and over that they weren't summarizing me.

I now believe this is a warning sign.

It's normal to forget once or twice, especially when fair fighting is new. But the rules aren't _that_ hard.

If a player consistently won't play by the rules, I believe they're indicating a deeper unwillingness to listen to their partner and resolve the conflict.

Fair fighting must be fair.

Conclusion
----------
Fair fighting was an epiphany for me.

No longer was conflict a nuclear meltdown, arcing off in all directions, leaving me with burnt eyebrows and irradiated feelings.

Now it's something with a logic: people escalate because they don't feel heard.

To keep conflict under control, create systems where people feel understood.

<!-- TODO link to inputs, not outputs -->

Now check out a neat thing:

When you summarize your partner, you're validating that what they're saying is real even if you don't agree.

You're projecting, "You are okay".

Even though fair fighting comes from negotiation and "I'm okay, you're okay" comes from psychotherapy, they're pointing at the same underlying thing.

We'll talk more about what that thing is and how to work with it in my next post, so subscribe to get it in your inbox when it's ready.

> 💡 If fair fighting resonated with you, I can't recommend enough [The Art of Negotiating the Best Deal[art-of-best-deal]. The entire thing was stuffed with useful knowledge, and well worth the $100-something I paid for it. The price has come down since then, making it an even easier endorsement.
