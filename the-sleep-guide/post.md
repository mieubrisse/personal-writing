I'd wrestled with insomnia for most of my life. It's now mostly solved. This article condenses my experience so you can fix yours, and explains why it's important to do so.

This will be useful if you:

- Vaguely know you "should" fix your sleep, but it doesn't feel a priority to do so
- Aren't tired when it's time for bed
- Lie in bed unable to fall asleep because your mind is racing
- Wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep
- Can't seem to keep a consistent bedtime

NOTE: I wrote this guide for the average person, keeping in mind "Could my mom read this?". I'm intentionally hiding scientific stuff behind links so that you have the option (but not the obligation) to engage at a more technical level.

<!--
You're going to be interested in this guide if you:

- You know sleep is important, but you can't seem to prioritize it
- Need to optimize your performance (as an entrepreneur, athlete, etc.)
- Can't fall asleep because your mind is racing
- Know you're supposed to go to bed, but you're not tired
- Wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep
- Can't keep a consistent bedtime & wake-up time
-->

Why Bother?
===========
We know we "should" fix our sleep. Yet we're blasted with information discouraging us from sleeping:

- Entrepreneurs on Instagram talking about their "grindset", and how little they sleep
- "I'll sleep when I'm dead" 
- "Sleep is for the weak"
- "Live fast, die young, leave a pretty corpse"
- "You Only Live Once (YOLO)"
- Party music encouraging us to "dance until the sun comes up"
- The famous "sleep faster" video from Arnold Schwarzeneggar
- People like Jocko Willink who claim they only need 4h of sleep, making us think "Maybe I could do that too?"

When this is what we consume, of course staying awake is the path we choose.

But you need to know: **sleep deprivation is poison for every system in your body.**

The science is very clear: if you are sleep-deprived, you are...

- [Destroying your mental performance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2656292)
- [Making yourself depressed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16259539/)
- [Making yourself anxious](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814343/)
- [Damaging your athletic performance, reducing muscle recovery, and increasing injury risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960533/#S13)
- [Progressing towards Alheimzer's and dementia](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/lack-sleep-may-be-linked-risk-factor-alzheimers-disease)
- [Increasing obesity and progressing towards diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929315/)
- [Making yourself feel bad, reducing your ability to emotionally regulate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193556/)
- [Increasing the chance you have a heart attack](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565718/)
- [Damaging your ability to form memories, including your immune system's "memory" of pathogens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3768102/)
- [Reducing your testosterone](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijsem/international-journal-of-sports-and-exercise-medicine-ijsem-6-169.php)

If you're not the science type, consider the effects you've undoubtedly already experienced:

- Unhealthy sugary, fatty food are more appealing than healthy foods
- Working out is harder, and you're more likely to skip it
- You're more likely to react angrily to irritations, leading to outbursts you have to fix later
- You're slow and inefficient in your work, thereby forcing you to work more
- You're more likely to favor short-term gratification (e.g. keep drinking)
- **You're more likely to stay up late doing passive consumption activities like Netflix or social media, thereby making you more tired**

Notice this last one. Sleep deprivation poisons with vicious cycles: if you get a little sleep deprived, it tends to lead to more sleep deprivation.

So here's me sounding the emergency: **if you're sleep deprived (which I can almost guarantee you are), you are destroying yourself**.

Now the good news:

Suppose I tell you I have [the miracle drug from the movie "Limitless"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(film)), and it also increases your athletic performance, and _also_ reduces your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's, anxiety, and depression.

Wouldn't you do a _lot_ to get that drug? Turns out that it exists, it's free, and it can be found in your bedroom. 

You can basically become superhuman by getting sufficient rest.

Understanding How Sleep Works
=============================
So how do we fix your sleep problems? First it's _very_ important that you understand how sleep works.

If you're feeling impatient ("Just tell me what to do!"), know that understanding _why_ and _how_ your body works is crucial to making long-term changes. 

If you don't understand how you work, you're not going to be able to self-diagnose and resolve the sleep problems you hit in the future.

We'll cover five things:

1. Your two nervous systems for stress
2. The chemical that makes you tired, adenosine
3. Your circadian clock
4. How to adjust your circadian clock
5. Melatonin

### Two Nervous Systems For Stress
Your body has two separate nervous systems for stress: 

1. **[Fight-or-flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system):** This activates during stressful situations, and is responsible for the release of adrenaline and cortisol. Think running away from a tiger: rapid breathing, pounding heart, wired muscles, intense focus.
2. **[Rest and digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system):** This turns off the fight-or-flight nervous system. Think calm, peace, relaxed muscles, sex, and **sleep**.

Importantly, _your body does not distinguish between types of stress_. 

A tiger attack, a cold shower, an argument with your romantic partner, and social anxiety from Instagram are all handled the same: your fight-or-flight nervous system gets activated. What changes is the degree of fight-or-flight activation.

Regardless of the cause, if your fight-or-flight system is activated then you're going to have a hard time falling asleep because your body is prepped to respond to stress.

### Adenosine
While you are awake and using energy, a chemical byproduct called "adenosine" is produced. Adenosine is a tiredness chemical: the more it builds up in your brain, the more "sleep pressure" you experience and the more tired you feel. 

Think of it like brakes for your brain: the harder your brain works, the more adenosine produced, the more your brain needs to slow down to do maintenance so it doesn't damage itself.

If you're living a clean life, you get tired near the end of the day, you sleep, your brain does maintenance, and the adenosine is cleaned out during sleep leaving you refreshed in the morning.

However, if you're not sleeping enough then you don't clear all the adenosine from your brain. You wake up tired and slow due to leftover adenosine. You have "sleep debt".

Things get worse with caffeine.

Caffeine blocks our brain from noticing adenosine, temporarily masking sleep pressure. You can't fall asleep when you've taken caffeine too close to bed because your body doesn't think it needs to sleep.

If you've ever had a caffeine crash, it's because adenosine has been steadily building but your brain didn't notice it due to caffeine's effects. When the caffeine wears off, your brain suddenly notices all the adenosine and you crash.

### The Circadian Clock
You've probably heard of your circadian rhythm, but what exactly is it?

Your brain has a little clock above the roof of your mouth that tracks when it thinks day and night are. It tries to make you alert at the start of the day, and sleepy 14-16 hours later.

It does this through two mechanisms. 

The first is body temperature. The higher your body temperature, the more alert and energized you are. The lower your body temperature, the sleepier and more sedentary.

When you sleep, your body temperature is low. As you wake up, your circadian clock triggers a body temperature increase and you feel energized.

As the day goes on:

1. You experience a body temperature peak (and feel most energized) around 3-4 hours after waking. You might have noticed this as mid-morning productivity.
1. You get a small temperature dip around 5-6 hours after waking, which you might recognize as the post-lunch slump (but which occurs _even if_ you don't eat lunch).
1. You get another peak around 10-12 hours after waking, which you might recognize as late afternoon productivity.
1. Your body temperature steadily declines from there, making you slow and sleepy.

You'll see this is true if you think to your own life:

- It's hard to sleep in a hot room because your body temperature can't drop the way it wants to.
- The reason it's so hard to wake up in the middle of the night to catch a flight is because your body is still cold and sleepy (and you likely haven't cleared all the adenosine from the day before).
- Cold showers and cold plunges wake you up because your body temperature needs to spike to keep you warm (and because your fight-or-flight nervous system activates).
- Exercising right before bed makes it hard to sleep because the activity artificially elevates your body temperature. It takes a couple hours for your temperature to come back down.
- Taking a warm shower or bath before bed helps you sleep because your body works to shed heat, which causes a body temperature drop when you get out.

The second way your circadian clock tries to keep you awake for 14-16 hours is cortisol.

Cortisol is a hormone that enhances alertness, counteracting the sleep pressure from adenosine. It's the same hormone produced by your fight-or-flight nervous system to keep you alert when your body is responding to stress. Cortisol itself is _not_ a bad thing; it's only bad when you're constantly flooded with too much.

Your circadian clock peaks your cortisol levels ~30-45 minutes after awakening, and then lets them decline over the rest of the day (allowing you to feel more sleep pressure). They hit their lowest levels during the first half of sleep, and then increase in the second half back to the peak after waking.

Caffeine also has an effect here. In addition to blocking your brain from noticing adenosine and sleep pressure, caffeine stimulates your fight-or-flight nervous system to produce cortisol. This artificially increases your wakefulness.

This identical to why can't fall asleep when you're feeling stressed: your fight-or-flight nervous system is producing cortisol, masking the sleep pressure from adenosine that you're feeling.

### Setting Your Circadian Clock
If you've ever taken a long flight going east, you've likely been hit by jet lag. You can't sleep when it's night, and you wake up at odd times.

Jet lag is when your circadian clock's idea of day and night don't match actual day and night. Those body temperature and cortisol peaks we just talked about are happening at the wrong times (e.g. in the middle of the actual night, instead of right after waking).

Fortunately, our circadian clock's idea of day & night can be adjusted by about 1 hour per day.

Adjustment happens through two main methods: light and food.

First, light: you have cells in the back of your eye that measure the intensity of light you're seeing. These cells train your circadian clock. Bright light exposure - and particularly light that comes from above you - hint to your circadian clock, "It is daytime; adjust yourself accordingly."

Coming from above? Yes; light from above makes a stronger adjustment to our circadian clock than light coming from below us (because the light-detecting cells are concentrated at the bottom of our eye). This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: we want our circadian clock adjusted by the sky above us but not the fire at our feet.

Artificial lights at night, particularly white or blue light, are clearly problematic. If we're getting exposed at night to the lights in our house, TVs, phones, or computers, we're telling our circadian clock, "It's daytime - shift yourself so that I'm awake during this hour. The absolute worst thing would be bright white fluorescent lights overhead.

So for the purposes of jet lag, you want to:

1. Get bright overhead light exposure early in the day after waking up, to reinforce "I should be awake staring when the sun comes up".
2. Avoid bright light exposure in the evening so you don't confuse your clock.

The second way your circadian clock adjusts is through food.

When you eat, you're telling your circadian clock, "Food is available during this period, so adjust yourself so I'm awake during this time."

I couldn't find a definitive reason why, but this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. In the ancient environment, food was much harder to find than it is today and ancient humans needed to adapt themselves to be alert when their prey was around. If the deer you normally eat only comes out at night, it makes sense that you're more awake at night.

The result is that if you eat food close to bed, you're telling your circadian clock, "Shift yourself to be awake during this time."

For the purposes of jet lag, you should eat on the meal schedules of the time zone you're on.

### Melatonin
The final piece to understand is melatonin. 

Adenosine and sleep pressure make you feel tired, but melatonin is what lets that tiredness turn into sleep. It does _not_ directly force you to sleep like a medication, but instead lowers body temperature, reduces cortisol keeping you awake, and lets sleep pressure result in sleep.

Your body produces melatonin in the darkness, and light exposure blocks melatonin production.

Therefore, artificial lights at night are doubly bad: you're incorrectly telling your circadian clock "You should be adjusting to think now is daytime," and you're suppressing melatonin production thereby preventing your ability to go to sleep.

You might have experienced this in your own life after a late-night videogaming, TV, or phone-scrolling session. Even though you're very tired (adenosine, sleep pressure), you can't fall asleep because your melatonin production has been impaired.

### Review
And that's what you need to know! 

To review:

- You have two nervous systems, a fight-or-flight one for stress and a rest & digest one for calm and sleep
- There's only one type of stress, your fight-or-flight nervous system produces cortisol as a result, and that cortisol keeps you awake
- Adenosine builds up as your awake, resulting in you feeling tired
- You have a biological clock that regulates your wakefulness and sleepiness with body temperature and cortisol
- Your biological clock gets set by eating and light exposure (particularly blue light from overhead)
- Melatonin lets sleep pressure turn into sleep

We'll next put all this information together to help you fix your sleep.

What Perfect Sleep Looks Like
=============================
To give you a target to aim for, the below is my understanding of what a "perfect" sleep routine might look like based on the way our bodies work.

This is **not** realistic for most people, and you **don't** have to do all of this. Most people - myself included - won't hit this because the sacrifices involved are just too restrictive. 

I'm giving this simply as a direction we can use to orient ourselves towards. Afterwards, I'll break it down into something more realistic.

- You sleep in a cool, dark, quiet room that can let morning light in at sunrise
- You wake around dawn, naturally, without an alarm clock, which is the same time you get up every day
- Rather than looking at phones or screens, the first thing you do is go for a ~10 minute walk under the sky to anchor your circadian clock with sunlight exposure (and wake you up with some exercise)
- You might take a cold shower
- You might go to the gym or do some other exercise to raise your body temperature and further help yourself wake up
- When you get back you eat breakfast, further signalling to your circadian clock that now is a good time to be awake
- You do not drink any caffeine or alcohol
- Throughout the day, you do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sex
    - You do not work in your bed
    - You do not read in bed
    - You do not play with your phone, work, or watch TV
- As the post-lunch slump happens, you might take a short nap
- You eat a relatively early dinner, around sunset
- After sunset, 2-3 hours before bed, you...
    - Stop strenuous physical exercise
    - Stop food intake
    - Disconnect from screens (phone, TV, computer, etc.) and the internet
    - Turn off overhead lights
    - Use dim, warm lights placed low in the room
    - Do a low-activation activity like reading, listening to a podcast, or listening to calming music
    - Might take a warm bath or shower
    - Might do some journalling
- When you get in bed you...
    - Wear a sleep tracker so you can get an idea of your actual sleep quality and duration
    - Consciously take deep, slow breaths, triggering your rest & digest nervous system
    - Keep your thoughts centered on a calm, soothing place, redirecting yourself back when you find yourself thinking, planning, or anticipating (as your bed is only for sleep & sex, not for thinking)
- If you find yourself unable to sleep, you...
    - Might try the [military sleep method](https://sleepdoctor.com/how-sleep-works/military-sleep-method) to help yourself relax
    - Might get up and do a calming activity in the dark elsewhere in your house so that you're not using your bed for thinking or planning
- If you wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep, you...
    - Do not turn on lights (e.g. no lights when using the bathroom)
    - Do not eat food
    - Might listen to some calming music, or a low-activation podcast or audiobook
- When you wake up you check your sleep tracker to see how you did

What Realistic Sleep Looks Like
===============================
Again, we don't need to be Perfect. I'll _never_ have a coffee? _Never_ stay up late with my friends? It's not reasonable.

But that's okay. We don't nedd to be Perfect; just need to be Good Enough.

By my definition, Good Enough means you regularly experience all of the following without chemical assistance like stimulants (e.g. caffeine) or sleeping pills:

1. You wake up easily feeling refreshed and energized
2. Your mind feels clear and quick throughout the day
3. You fall asleep easily at the end of the day

### Good Enough
To get there, I think about "gracefully degrading" the Perfect ideal into something that I can actually maintain. Here's what I'm currently doing in my own life:

- I sleep in a bedroom with a blackout curtain that I lower nearly all the way down, but not entirely so that a bit of morning light can come in
- I sleep with earplugs ([I recommend this brand](TODO)), as I live in a noisy city and [sound can decrease sleep quality without waking you up](TODO) (I definitely notice that my sleep quality is worse without earplugs)
- I turn on the air conditioner whenever I'm in doubt about temperature, as I tend to run hot and don't like waking up in the middle of the night sweating
- I wake between 05:00 and 06:00 with [an alarm clock app](TODO) that plays wave sounds - softly at first, and then getting louder and more insistent over 5 minutes to pull me out of sleep more gradually
- I get out of bed immediately, and pull the blackout shades all the way up to let in full sunlight
- Depending on the day of the week, I then try to anchor my circadian clock with daylight and exercise:
    - Eat a banana, bike to the park, and do an hour of yoga or functional training
    - Go for a 10-minute walk around my neighborhood while listening to an audiobook or podcast
- When I get back I evaluate how much more alert I need to be and choose between a cold shower and a warm (but not hot) one
- I do mindfulness meditation for at least 10 minutes afterwards
- I then eat breakfast
- I might have a single cup of caffeinated coffee, so long as it's before ~10:30am and I'm taking the coffee crash and lack of sleep later
    - I do this because I love coffee, even though I know it's best to have no coffee
    - The "before 10:30" rule is because my body processes caffeine slower than normal due to my genetics, so caffeine stays in my system longer than most people
    - I do this only 1-2 days per week max
    - When I do drink coffee, I have a noticeable crash in the late afternoon: a spike in anxiety, tiredness, and feeling bad about myself and life that requires discipline to remember is from the coffee (and I don't need to freak out and change anything)
- When feeling tired throughout the day I occasionally lay on my bed, though I'm trying to cut this habit so that my bed is strictly for sleep and sex
    - I never work in my bed
- If I feel tired in the afternoon I might take a 1-2 hour nap (though I think this is too long and I'm experimenting with reducing it)
    - Somebody once told me, "I sleep when I'm tired" and this resonated with me
- My last workout of the day is in the early afternoon, ending by 4-5pm
- I try to finish eating by ~7pm, though sometimes this gets stretched to 8pm
    - When I eat late, I notice a harder time falling asleep
- At 7:30pm I've configured [this Chrome browser extension](TODO) to block Youtube, Reddit, Instagram, and a news site I read, as a safeguard in case I got caught in a scrolling spiral
    - I don't have my phone block Instagram because sometimes I want to post Stories of what I do after 7:30pm
    - This is less dangerous for me because I use (and highly recommend) [this modded version of Instagram](TODO) that disables the Feed and all the crap on the Search page
- I also have apps on my phone and laptop that tint my screen orange at night to block blue light:
    - On my phone, I use [Twilight](TODO)
    - On my laptop, I use [f.lux](TODO)
- Around 8:30pm I:
    - Turn off all lights in my apartment except for dim, low ones
    - Stop all screens
    - Take a warm shower
    - Might do some journalling in my pen-and-paper journal about the day, focusing on the things that went right rather than the things that went wrong (to decrease my stress rather than increase it)
    - Might lay on my couch and look out the window while listening to a non-activating audiobook
        - I've found that books with useful information (e.g. business books) tend to be activating, since I'm trying to pay attention and remember everything
        - I'm still experimenting with a good way to find non-activating books; my best guess is a book that makes you go "Huh, interesting" but doesn't feel like you need to apply the lessons in your life right now
- Between 21:00 and 21:30 I'll crawl into bed
    - I'm always wearing my [Fitbit Inspire 3](TODO) to bed, which will log my sleep duration & quality overnight
    - As I lie in bed, I try to slow my breathing by 50% and think about a calming place
- At 22:30pm I have my phone and laptop configured to block certain apps, as an extra safeguard in case I got caught in a bad scrolling spiral
    - On my phone, I use [AppBlock](TODO) to block Instagram and Discord
    - On my laptop I use [the Mac Downtime feature](TODO) to block everything except Notion, the app that I write in, Spotify, and ChatGPT
- I commonly catch myself in bed thinking about the past, planning for the future, or trying to resolve a problem; when I catch this, I remind myself that my bed is not for thinking and try to redirect my thoughts back to a calm, neutral place
    - For me, this is a rock I used to sit on on the shore of a lake at a summer camp I used to go to as a child
- If I have to go to the bathroom, I do so in the dark
- If I'm still awake after 20-30 minutes, I'll try the [military sleep method](https://sleepdoctor.com/how-sleep-works/military-sleep-method) to see if I can relax enough to sleep
- If I still can't sleep (usually because of food, exercise, or coffee early), or I wake up and can't get back to sleep, I'll get up and try to do something calming: writing, listening to a non-activating audiobook in the dark on my couch
- If I 
- When I wake up I check my sleep duration and quality in the Fitbit app (it's almost always less than I thought)

### Measuring Caffeine
As you now know, caffeine blocks your body's ability to measure how tired it is. It also spikes your fight-or-flight nervous system.

I find it helpful to know how many milligrams of caffeine stuff has, so I know how wired something will get me. Here are some standard values:

- Green tea: 15mg
- Black tea: 30mg
- Normal soda: 30mg
- Single shot of espresso: 75mg
- 250ml (~8oz) can of Red Bull energy drink: 80mg
- 8oz cup of regular coffee: 80-100mg
- Cup of coffee at a chain: usually 90-180mg (e.g. [here's Starbucks](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-complete-guide-to-starbucks-caffeine))
- ~450ml (16oz) can of Monster energy drink: 160mg
- Exercise preworkout: 175-300mg

You can find values for basically anything you can think of on [Caffeine Informer](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/).

### Getting To Good Enough
As you make changes in your own life, it's important that you _take things slow_.

I'm a firm believer in "consistency over intensity". If you try to change everything all at once you'll feel excited at first. Then the changes will start to feel like a lot of work, and you'll begin to feel stressed. Eventually you'll procrastinate a bit on what you know you're supposed to do. Eventually you'll quit, and be back exactly where you started with no progress. 

So take it slow. Experiment with changing one thing at a time.

Put another way, you got your bad sleep habits through years of poor choices. You're not going to fix it in a week _and that's okay_.

To keep you motivated, I strongly recommend a sleep-tracking wearable. Just like in the gym, you can use it to help you see progress.

When you slip up (which will inevitably happen; it's okay!), you'll see the negative impact it has on your sleep.

<!--
### Phase 1: Stop Immediate Damage (probably 3-4 weeks)
As I mentioned earlier, being sleep-deprived can trigger poor choices that lead to further sleep deprivation. This phase is about stopping that damage. 

The theme, again, is **consistency over intensity**. Each day of this phase should feel easy to achieve. As you stack up days though, you'll find yourself going where you need to go.

**Bedtime Screen Ban + TODOOOOOOO**
As we talked about earlier, light (and particularly blue light from above) tells your body "you need to be awake now". More light at night = you stay up later = you get less sleep = you are more tired = you are more likely to reach for stimulants like caffeine to get you through the day.

Beyond this, the stuff on your screens - social media, videogames, shows, the internet - tend to activate you. The show you're watching has you on the edge of your seat, or you're comparing yourself to that other person on Instagram, or you're engaged in complex problem-solving in a videogame.

To fix this, we're going to work up to no screens 1 hour before you physically get in bed. Once you are in bed, 

We'll do this in 10-minute increments. The first day you won't use any screens 10 minutes before you get in bed, then the second day 20 minutes before bed, and so on until you arrive at no screens 60 minutes before bed. If you fail a day, 

If you currently have a habit of using screens before bed, it's particularly important that you substitute somethin

To do so, we're going to substitute 

**Caffeine Elimination**
As you now know, caffeine blocks your body's ability to measure how tired it is. It also spikes your fight-or-flight nervous system. Throughout this phase, we're going to walk your caffeine consumption down to zero so your body can start to understand how tired it actually is.

If you don't take any caffeine right now, amazing - your job is easy this phase.

If you're a heavy caffeine user, remember **consistency over intensity**. Trying to stop all caffeine intake in a day is a bad idea because it'll give you headaches and mood swings that will drag you back to caffeine.

To get to zero, first calculate your daily caffeine intake in milligrams (mg). I've listed some common caffeinated items below to give you a rough idea; you can use [Caffeine Informer](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database) to find more.

- Green tea: 15mg
- Black tea: 30mg
- Single shot of espresso: 75mg
- 250ml (~8oz) can of Red Bull energy drink: 80mg
- 8oz cup of regular coffee: 80-100mg
- Cup of coffee at a chain: usually 90-180mg (e.g. [here's Starbucks](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-complete-guide-to-starbucks-caffeine))
- ~450ml (16oz) can of Monster energy drink: 160mg
- Exercise preworkout: 175-300mg



**Phase End**
This phase is complete when you have completed 14 consecutive days without caffeine or screens 1 hour before bed. If you find the challenges hard to

FAQ
====
### I'm not tired when it's time for bed
There are quite a few things that could be causing this:

- You're drinking too much coffee too close to bed which is activating your fight-or-flight nervous system and blocking you from feeling sleep pressure
    - SOLUTION: no coffee after 11:00am
- You exercised within 2-3h of when you wanted to sleep and your body is still activated
    - SOLUTION: exercise in the morning or afternoon
- You've been blasting your eyes with light at night so you don't have enough melatonin built up to sleep
    - SOLUTION: stop screens and overhead light 1-1.5h before the time you want to be in bed
- Your circadian clock isn't anchored on actual sunrise (perhaps due to jetlag, perhaps because you've been confusing it with light or eating at night)
    - SOLUTION: get 10+ minutes of daylight immediately upon waking and eat food after, and 2 hours before bedtime stop eating, overhead lights, and screens
- You're sleeping at different times each night, so your circadian clock doesn't have a consistent sleep time that it can prepare you for
    - SOLUTION: get daylight right when you wake up to anchor your circadian clock, and go to bed at roughly the same time each night
- Your fight-or-flight nervous system is still activated, preventing you from noticing sleep pressure
    - SOLUTION: do something calming: a guided meditation while laying quietly, calming music, journalling, a peaceful audiobook, etc.
- You took too long of a nap too close to bedtime, so you don't have sufficient sleep pressure built up
    - SOLUTION: limit naps to TODO hours, and more than TODO hours before bed

### I go to bed, but I can't switch my brain off
This is very likely your fight-or-flight nervous system keeping you alert because it thinks there's a threat you need to react to. 

Your body treats all stress the same, so your troubles at work or in your relationship are activating the same stress response as physical danger. Try to figure out what your mind is holding on to, and see if you can tell it, "There's nothing I can do about this right now. There's nothing to be done. We'll address this tomorrow." 

Sometimes, our mind is hanging on to something because it's afraid we'll forget it. It sometimes helps me to write the thing I'm worrying about in a place where I'll see it the next morning, so my mind trusts that I'll handle it later (credit to ["Getting Things Done"](TODO) for this trick). Often I have to do this a couple times, until my mind lets go of everything it was hanging on to.

Sometimes though, you just mess up. You ate, or exercised, or were on screens, or took coffee too close to bed. It's okay, it happens. 

It's important that you don't beat yourself up, or get freaked out about how tired you're going to be tomorrow, because then you're just activating your fight-or-flight nervous system and making it even harder to fall asleep. Just like a pilot coming in for a bad landing, just pull up and come around again. Get out of bed so that you're not using bed for thinking/stressing/worrying, and do something calming: writing, listening to podcast or audiobook, etc. Try again in 20-30 minutes, or when you feel tired again.

### I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep
People assume this is bad and get stressed out about it, making it harder to sleep again. But it's not necessarily bad!

There's decent evidence that before the invention of artificial lights, [humans slept in two phases with a brief awake period between them](TODO). Supposedly this middle-of-the-night awake time felt very calm and peaceful. Rarely, when I'm very well-rested, I've experienced something sort of like this. 

So don't worry; just do something calming to get back to sleep. And **definitely** don't turn on any lights!

### I wake up tired
This could be for several reasons:

- You didn't sleep long enough, meaning you didn't fully clear the adenosine/sleep pressure from the previous day
    - SOLUTON: make the conscious choice to prioritize sufficient sleep, remembering that days of heavy brain or body exertion require more rest
- You're waking up before your usual wakeup time and your body is still cold with low cortisol (e.g. you had to wake up early to catch a flight)
    - SOLUTION: get moving to warm your body up, though be conscious that light and food will pull your circadian clock's wake-up time earlier
- You're not sleeping on a regular schedule, and are instead getting 8 hours randomly.
    - SOLUTION:
- You have sleep apnea, which is causing micro-wakeups that are preventing you from getting restful sleep
    - SOLUTION: get a sleep tracker that monitors noise and oxygen levels, and see a doctor if you're hearing gasping or seeing your oxygen levels drop in the night
- Your room is too hot, causing micro-wakeups
    - SOLUTION: cool your room, preferably to ~20 Celsius/68 Fahrenheit
- Your partner is disturbing you as you sleep, causing micro-wakeups 
    - SOLUTION: consider a bigger bed, separate blankets, or a mattress with a foam that isolates movement
- Sounds are causing micro-wakeups
    - SOLUTION: get better sound isolating in your room, and consider earplugs

### I can't seem to keep a consistent bedtime
Several things to consider:

- Are you getting a strong blast of daylight as soon as you get up? This will help with falling asleep 14-16 hours later.
- Are you irradiating your eyes with light at night (screens, lights), suppressing melatonin production and making it difficult for you to sleep?
- Are you doing activating things (food, exercise, social media, videogames, etc.) before bed, making it harder to fall asleep?

### I'm flying east on an airplane and will be jetlagged
Because you flew east, this is true jetlag: your body thinks it should still be sleeping at sunrise, and it thinks it should still be awake at night.

Before you go, you can start shifting your circadian clock to your destination. To do so:
- Start waking up at sunrise at your destination
- Turn on bright indoor lights as soon as you get up, to start adjusting your circadian clock earlier
- Eat yoru breakfast at the breakfast time of your destination
- Stop eating, exercise, screens etc. around sunset at your destination

You could also consider melatonin supplementation to help you fall asleep earlier, though I personally choose not to take it. I avoid drugs when possible.

When you arrive, you can do the same stuff from Good Enough sleep: get up around sunrise, go for walk, eat when you get back, etc.

Remember that your circadian clock can adjust by about 1 hour per day, so it's going to take some time to fully align with the local timezone.

### I'm flying west on an airplane and will be jetlagged
This type of jetlag is easier and faster to fix. Basically, you just need to stay up via caffeine, exercise, etc. You're going to build a tremendous amount of sleep pressure from staying up so long, so it should be easy to fall asleep as long as you're not suppressing melatonin production by receiving light near bedtime.

### I'm sleep deprived; now what?
The first thing to remember is that you're not thinking straight. You're more anxious, more depressed, more negative, and more fearful. This can lead to reactive decisions about your life, job, or relationships that wouldn't be a big deal if you were well-rested.

I like to remind myself, "No judgments about my life until the dark circles are gone from under my eyes."

Second, you're going to want to reach for your stimulant of choice (probably caffeine) to help you get through the tiredness. It's very important you resist this urge! If you take the stimulant, you'll mess up your sleep that night, which means you won't get better.

If it helps, you can think about it as: you took out a sleep loan from the back in the past. Now you have to pay it back. Be more careful taking out that sleep loan in the future.

Third, remember that your tiredness will make you want to reach for "easy" dopamine: social media, Youtube, Netflix, etc. It's especially important you avoid this entertainment because your defenses are down so you're more likely to get into a bad spiral, and the screens will mess up your sleep. If you mess up your sleep, you'll never get better.

Instead, contemplate doing some journalling, meditation, or listening to an audiobook.

### What about supplements like magnesium?
TODO

### What about naps?
TODO

### What about white noise?
I personally use noise to help block out any sounds my earplugs don't catch. Noises come in various "colors", and I find white noise to be pretty harsh. I like brown noise better, so I [have an app that I use](TODO).

### Should I take melatonin supplementation?
I've used melatonin in the past to help with getting to sleep on airplanes and when flying west -> east. On the Andrew Huberman podcast about sleep he mentioned that melatonin (which is a hormone) can affect various systems, so I avoid it to be safe. I personally recommend a life of minimal substances, but the choice is yours.

Fun Sleep Facts
===============
### Glymphatic System
Your brain cells contract when you sleep. This opens up channels between the brain cells which are used for flushing away cellular waste, like sewers. This is called your **glymphatic system**. When you don't get enough sleep, it's like your brain cells keep producing garbage but the garbage truck never comes. The trash just keeps accumulating.

### Circadian Rhythm Isn't Exactly 24h
TODO your circadian rhythm is not naturally 24h! It's actually a little bit wrong, so light is necessary to keep it on track (also important for seasons)
TODO cite study where dude stayed down in cave, and the circadian rhythm extended longer to 26h

### Biphasic Sleep

Fundamentals: Understanding Your Body
=====================================
To fix your sleep problems, I need to teach you some important things about how your body works.

### Two Nervous Systems
You have two opposing nervous systems:

1. **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS):** This is your "fight or flight" nervous system. It's responsible for alertness, attention focus, and the stress response. It releases adrenaline during dangerous or high-energy activities such as fighting or sports, and also cortisol during longer periods of stress.
2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS):** This is your "rest and digest" nervous system. It's responsible for relaxation, metabolism, and energy conservation. When engaged, it turns off the stress response and brings us back to a calm place so digestion can occur. 

To remember the difference, think:

- Sympathetic nervous system is "sympathetic" to your danger
- "parar" in Spanish/Portuguese means "to stop"; the parasympathetic nervous system is all about stopping and relaxing

### The Sympathetic Is Stronger
The sympathetic nervous system is faster and stronger than parasympathetic nervous system. You can shoot to 100% stress level in seconds, but it will take hours to come back down.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: if you're getting chased by a tiger, running away is far more important than sleeping or digestion - even if you're very tired.

This means that it's possible to get into chronic stress states where the sympathetic nervous system is dominating. It's like you're "hooked" in a high-stress state, seemingly unable to come down.

### There's Only One Type Of Stress
Your sympathetic nervous system doesn't distinguish between physical vs psychological stressors. All of these are handled the same:

- A tiger chasing you
- A work deadline
- A stressful videogame
- Financial debt
- An aggressive person on the street at night
- Failing an exam
- Your partner arguing with you
- Feeling inadequate comparing oneself to others on social media
- Feeling socially rejected

### The Sympathetic Grabs Focus, But Too Much Is Bad
The sympathetic nervous system grabs our attention. You've felt this any time you've:

- Been in a dangerous situation
- Been involved in a tricky merge while driving, and you don't hear what your passenger is saying
- Been locked in to meet a very tight deadline

In these situations, the SNS grabbing focus is a good thing.

However, the SNS's attention-grabbing power can be disruptive when it's too active for too long:

- You're trying to read but your attention is constantly yanked back to the argument you had with your partner
- You're anxious, constantly scanning for danger
- Social media notifications constantly interrupt your focus, making you unproductive at work

### The Circadian Clock
Your body has an internal clock that tells your body when to start feeling sleepy and when to wake up. 

It works via cortisol and melatonin.

It works by hormone release, and body temperature.

High body temperature


- High temperature = energy, reaction time, physical performance
- Low temperature = sleepiness
- Darkness = "it's nighttime" = produce melatonin
- Body temperature rises in morning, peaks in afternoon, drops at night
- Warm showers cool by increasing blood flow to skin, which accelerates heat loss when you get out
- Sudden cold = wakefulness (via SNS activation, increases body temperature via brown fat activation)
- Gradual cold (cold room) = helps sleepiness by gradual heat loss
- Bright light (especially blue light) = "it's daytime" = suppress melatonin production, shift your circadian rhythm
- Sleepiness starts 12-16 hours after waking up
- Temporary dip 7-9 hours after waking
- Cortisol (circadian alerting signal) peaks in the morning

- Exercise in morning/afternoon raise body temperature, promote wakefulness
- Exercise at night raises body temperature, makes it harder to fall asleep

To start feeling sleepy, your body temperature 

When it's time to fall asleep, your body starts releasing melatonin

The clock is adjustable 

This clock is adjusted by exposing your eyes to light. Bright morning/sunrise light = "stay awake". Dim,

Specifically,  TODOOOOOOOOOOOOO

### Light
- Light + seratonin = wakefulness
- Darkness + seratonin = melatonin

### Eating & Sleep
- Liver & gut have peripheral clocks
- Morning meals signal "daytime" = alertness
- Fasting & high-protein meals promote wakefulness
- Eating too close to bed raises body temperature (delaying sleep) and messing with liver & gut clocks

### Adenosine & Sleep Pressure
- Adenosine the result of brain using energy
- Accumulates while you're awake
- Sufficient sleep clears adenosine and resets wakefulness
- If you don't sleep enough, adenosine is high the next day (tiredness)

### Social Interaction
Social engagement and cognitive tasks increase dopamine, norepinephrine, and orexin, keeping you alert.

How it Affects Wakefulness:
- Isolation or lack of stimulation can increase drowsiness.
- Engaging in conversation, learning, or problem-solving keeps the brain awake.

TODO Dopamine increases wakefulness!

I used to be like these people. **I believe this is exceedingly dangerous.**

### My Story
It was the end of 2023, and I was 32. I'd been grinding hard on my startup, sleeping an average 6h40m per night for over a year. I was deeply stressed, and I began to experience inexplicable medical symptoms: 

Sentences didn't make sense unless I read them 2-3 times. My speech wasn't completely under my control, with words getting substituted  (e.g. wanting to say "New Year" but "New York" came out instead). My hands were trembling slightly, and "w"s and "m"s were particularly difficult to write. My vision was trembling slightly, as if the world was having a very minor earthquake. My balance was affected, as if I were on a very slightly moving ship. It was difficult to remember things from a few days ago.

I visited several doctors, including two neurologists. I got tested for multiple sclerosis. Everything came back negative. Nobody could explain what was wrong with me beyond "stress".

I took a month off work as a last resort. Finally... the symptoms started to ease.

It's 2025 as I write this, and I'm mostly back to normal. My hands, memory, and reading comprehension returned. However, I'm not completely fixed. My balance and vision are still slightly wobbly, and my speech still feels awkward at times.

### Aftermath
As I told my burnout story to others in the months that followed, people began to tell me theirs. Crazy stuff: one friend with partial facial paralysis, another with autoimmune-like attacks in her digestive system, another with anxiety attacks.

In all stories, the person's sleep is shit.

I'm not a sleep researcher, but it seems staggeringly clear that sleep is our body's maintenance. If we skip it, our bodies fall apart in basically every way possible:

- [Lack of sleep is increasingly being linked to Alheimzer's and dementia](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/lack-sleep-may-be-linked-risk-factor-alzheimers-disease)
- [Lack of sleep is strongly linked to depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16259539/)
- [Lack of sleep is linked to anxiety as well as depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814343/)
- [Lack of sleep harms athletic performance, reducing performance, reducing muscle recovery, and increasing injury risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960533/#S13)
- [Lack of sleep is linked to diabetes & obesity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929315/)
- [Lack of sleep makes you feel worse, and reduces your ability to emotionally regulate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193556/)
- [Lack of sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565718/)
- [Lack of sleep damages your ability to form memories, including your immune system's "memory" of pathogens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3768102/)
- [Lack of sleep reduces testosterone in males](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijsem/international-journal-of-sports-and-exercise-medicine-ijsem-6-169.php)

As if that's not enough, consider the secondary effects of sleep deprivation you've experienced in your own life:

- Unhealthy sugary, fatty food are more appealing than healthy foods
- Working out is harder, and you're more likely to skip it
- You're more likely to react angrily to irritations, leading to outbursts you have to mend later
- You're not efficient in your work
- You're more likely to keep drinking
- **You're more likely to stay up late doing passive consumption activities like Netflix or social media, thereby making you more tired**

It's not at all surprising that I, and the people I talked to, started to fall apart. **Sleep deprivation is poison!**

Here's the craziest part though:
