I'd wrestled with insomnia for most of my life. It's now mostly solved. This article concentrates my experience so you can fix yours, and explains why it's important to do so.

This will be useful if you:

- Know you "should" fix your sleep, but it doesn't feel like a priority to do so
- Aren't tired when it's time for bed
- Lie in bed unable to fall asleep because your mind is racing
- Wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep
- Can't seem to keep a consistent bedtime

NOTE: I wrote this guide for the average person. My test was, "Could my mom read this?". I hid scientific stuff inside links so that you can engage with it if you want to, but aren't forced to.

<!--
You're going to be interested in this guide if you:

- You know sleep is important, but you can't seem to prioritize it
- Need to optimize your performance (as an entrepreneur, athlete, etc.)
- Can't fall asleep because your mind is racing
- Know you're supposed to go to bed, but you're not tired
- Wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep
- Can't keep a consistent bedtime & wake-up time
-->

Why Bother?
===========
We know we "should" fix our sleep. Yet we're blasted with information discouraging us from sleeping:

- Entrepreneurs on Instagram talking about their "grindset", and how little they sleep
- "I'll sleep when I'm dead" 
- "Sleep is for the weak"
- "Live fast, die young, leave a pretty corpse"
- "You Only Live Once (YOLO)"
- Party music encouraging us to "dance until the sun comes up"
- The famous "sleep faster" video from Arnold Schwarzeneggar
- People like Jocko Willink who claim they only need 4h of sleep, making us think "Maybe that's me too?"

When we're presented this information every day, of course staying pushing through tiredness seems reasonable.

But you need to know: **sleep deprivation is poison for every system in your body.**

The science is exceedingly clear. If you are sleep-deprived, you are...

- [Destroying your mental performance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2656292)
- [Making yourself depressed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16259539/)
- [Making yourself anxious](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814343/)
- [Damaging your athletic performance, reducing muscle recovery, and increasing injury risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960533/#S13)
- [Progressing towards Alheimzer's and dementia](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/lack-sleep-may-be-linked-risk-factor-alzheimers-disease)
- [Increasing obesity and progressing towards diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929315/)
- [Making yourself feel bad, reducing your ability to emotionally regulate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193556/)
- [Increasing the chance you have a heart attack](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565718/)
- [Damaging your ability to form memories, including your immune system's "memory" of invaders](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3768102/)
- [Reducing your testosterone](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijsem/international-journal-of-sports-and-exercise-medicine-ijsem-6-169.php)

But you don't need to read a study to understand this. Consider what you've already noticed in your own life when you're sleep-deprived:

- Sugary, fatty food are more appealing than healthy foods
- Working out is harder, and you're more likely to skip it
- You're more likely to explode at irritations, leading to problems you have to fix later
- You're slow and inefficient in your work
- You're more likely to favor short-term gratification (e.g. keep drinking, not worrying about tomorrow)
- **You're more likely to stay up late passively consuming Netflix or social media, thereby making you more tired the next day**

Notice this last one. Sleep deprivation poisons with destructive cycles: if you get a little sleep deprived, it often leads to more sleep deprivation.

So here's me sounding the alarm: **if you're sleep deprived (which I can almost guarantee you are), you are destroying yourself**.

Now the good news:

Suppose I tell you I have [the miracle drug from the movie "Limitless"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(film)). But it doesn't just increase your mental performance. It also increases your athletic performance, and protects against cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, _and_ obesity, Alzheimer's, anxiety, and depression.

Wouldn't you do a lot to get that drug? 

Turns out that drug exists, it's free, and it can be found in your bedroom. 

You can basically become superhuman by getting sufficient rest.

Understanding How Sleep Works
=============================
So how do we fix your sleep problems? First it's _very_ important that you understand how sleep works.

If you're thinking "Just tell me what to do!", know that understanding _how_ sleep works is essential to actually fixing your sleep. Sleep can feel random: sometimes we can fall asleep easily, other times we can't. It's understandable to think, "Well, that's just how sleep is."

But sleep is governed by biological rules. If you know those rules, you'll understand why you can and can't fall asleep on certain days. If you know those rules, you'll understand how to fix your problems on your own.

We'll cover six things:

1. Your two nervous systems for stress
2. Why you feel tired
3. The internal clock your body uses to track day and night
4. How to adjust your internal clock
5. Why you fall asleep

### Two Nervous Systems For Stress
Your body has two separate nervous systems for stress: 

1. **[Fight-or-flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system):** This activates during stressful situations. It's responsible for the release of adrenaline and cortisol. Think running away from a tiger: rapid breathing, pounding heart, wired muscles, intense focus.
2. **[Rest and digest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system):** This deactivates the fight-or-flight nervous system. Think calm, peace, relaxed muscles, sex, and **sleep**.

The fight-or-flight system is stronger and faster. It can activate in a second (remember the last time you got surprised?), and it keeps you awake even when you're tired. The rest-and-digest is slower; it takes a while to calm you down.

If your fight-or-flight system is activated, you're going to have a hard time falling asleep.

Also important: _your body does not distinguish between physical and psychological stress_.

All of the following are the same from your body's perspective: a tiger attack, a cold shower, an argument with your romantic partner, and social anxiety from Instagram. The only difference is how much the fight-or-flight system is activated.

Therefore, any type of stress = difficulty falling asleep.

### Why You Feel Tired
While you are awake, a chemical called **adenosine** is produced. Adenosine is a tiredness chemical: the more it builds up in your brain, the more desire to sleep you feel. This is called **sleep pressure**.

Think of it like brakes for your brain: the harder your brain works, the more adenosine gets created, and the more your brain needs to slow down to do maintenance so it doesn't damage itself.

In the natural flow of things, the built-up sleep pressure means you get tired near the end of the day, you sleep, your brain does maintenance, and the adenosine is cleaned out during sleep. You wake in the morning feeling refreshed.

However, if you're not sleeping enough then you don't clean the adenosine from your brain. You wake up tired and slow due to leftover adenosine. You have **sleep debt**.

Things get worse with caffeine.

Caffeine prevents our brain from noticing adenosine, so we don't notice that we're tired. The adenosine is still building; our brain just can't see it.

If you've ever had a caffeine crash, it's because the caffeine wore off and your brain suddenly noticed all the built-up adenosine.

### Your Internal Clock
Your brain has a little clock called the **circadian clock** that keeps track of day and night. It tries to wake you up at sunrise, keep you alert throughout the day, and put you to sleep 14-16 hours after you wake up.

It controls your body through two methods.

The first is body temperature. The higher your body temperature, the more alert and energized you are. The lower your body temperature, the sleepier and more sedentary. 

Your circadian clock is constantly changing your body temperature throughout the day. It normally looks like this:

1. Your body temperature is lowest in the middle of the night, as you're in deep sleep.
1. As you get closer to waking up, your body temperature increases.
1. You experience a body temperature peak (and feel most energized) around 3-4 hours after waking. You might have noticed this as mid-morning productivity.
1. You get a small temperature dip around 5-6 hours after waking, which you might recognize as the post-lunch slump. It's caused by your circadian clock; it will happen even if you don't eat lunch!
1. You get another peak around 10-12 hours after waking, which you might recognize as late afternoon productivity.
1. Your body temperature steadily declines from there, making you slow and sleepy.

You'll see this is true if you think to your own life:

- It's hard to sleep in a hot room because your body temperature can't drop the way it wants to.
- It's hard to wake up in the middle of the night to catch a flight because your body is still cold and sleepy (and you likely haven't cleared all the adenosine from the day before).
- Cold showers and cold plunges wake you up because your body temperature needs to spike to keep you warm (and because your fight-or-flight nervous system activates).
- Exercising right before bed makes it hard to sleep because exercise elevates your body temperature and activates your fight-or-flight nervous system. It takes a couple hours for your temperature and stress level to come down.
- Taking a hot shower before bed helps you sleep because your body lowers its tempearture to avoid overheating. When you get out of the shower, your body temperature is lower.

The second way your circadian clock works to keep you awake for 14-16 hours is a stress chemical called **cortisol**.

Cortisol enhances alertness, blocking the sleep pressure from adenosine. It's the same chemical produced by your fight-or-flight nervous system to keep you alert when your body is responding to stress. Cortisol itself is not a bad thing! It's a natural part of your body. It's only bad when your cortisol levels are high for long periods of time.

Your circadian clock peaks your cortisol levels ~30-45 minutes after awakening, and then lets them decline over the rest of the day (allowing you to feel more sleep pressure). They hit their lowest levels during the first half of sleep, and then increase in the second half of sleep until you wake up.

Caffeine is harmful here too.

In addition to blocking your brain from noticing adenosine and sleep pressure, caffeine stimulates your fight-or-flight nervous system to produce cortisol. This artificially raises your cortisol and increases wakefulness.

This is why you feel wired on caffeine. Your fight-or-flight nervous system is activated.

### Adjusting Your Internal Clock
Our circadian clock does its best to keep track of day and night, but it can be wrong.

If you've ever taken a long flight going east, you've likely experienced jet lag. You can't sleep when it's night, and you wake up at odd times.

Jet lag is when your circadian clock's idea of day and night don't match actual day and night. The body temperature and cortisol peaks we just talked about are happening at the wrong times (e.g. in the middle of the actual night, instead of right after waking).

Fortunately, our circadian clock's idea of day & night can be adjusted by about 1 hour per day.

Adjustment happens through two main methods: light and food.

First, light: you have sensors in the back of your eye that measure the intensity of light you're seeing. These cells train your circadian clock. Seeing bright light - and particularly bright blue light that comes from above you - tell your circadian clock, "It's daytime; adjust yourself."

Wait, "blue light that comes from above you"?

Yep. Blue light coming from above you makes a stronger adjustment to our circadian clock because the light sensors are located mostly in the bottom of our eyes. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: we want our circadian clock adjusted by the blue sky above us but not the orange fire at our feet.

Artificial lights at night, particularly white or blue light, are problematic. If it's nighttime but we're receiving light through lamps and screens, we're telling our circadian clock, "It's daytime; adjust yourself so that I'm awake during this hour". The absolute worst thing would be bright white fluorescent lights above you.

The second way your circadian clock adjusts itself is through food.

When you eat, you're telling your circadian clock, "Food is available at this time, so adjust yourself so I'm awake during this time".

I couldn't find a clear reason why in my research, but this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Food was much harder to find in ancient times than it is today, and ancient humans needed to adapt themselves to be awake when their food was available. If the deer you normally eat only comes out at night, it makes sense that you're more awake at night.

The result is that if you eat food close to bed, you're telling your circadian clock, "Shift yourself to be awake during this time".

### Why You Fall Asleep
Sleep pressure - built-up adenosine - makes you feel tired, but it's not what actually puts you to sleep. Your body produces a chemical called **melatonin** that lets your tiredness turn into sleep. 

Melatonin does _not_ directly force you unconscious like sleep medication. Instead it lets sleep pressure turn into sleep by lowering your body temperature and reducing cortisol that's keeping you awake.

Those light intensity sensors in your eyes?

When they detect darkness they tell your body to start producing melatonin, and when they detect light they tell your body to stop producing melatonin.

Therefore, artificial lights at night are doubly bad. They incorrectly tell your circadian clock, "It's daytime; adjust yourself", and they block melatonin production so you can't sleep even if you're tired.

You might have experienced this in your own life after a late-night videogaming, TV, or phone-scrolling session. Even though you're tired (sleep pressure, built-up adenosine), you can't fall asleep because you don't have enough melatonin.

### Review
And that's what you need to know for now!

To review:

- You have two nervous systems, a fight-or-flight one for stress and a rest & digest one for calm and sleep
- Your body doesn't distinguish between physical and psychological stress
- Sleep pressure builds up as you're awake due to built-up adenosine, resulting in you feeling tired
- You have a biological clock that regulates your wakefulness and sleepiness with body temperature and cortisol
- Your biological clock gets set by eating and light exposure (particularly blue light from above you)
- Melatonin lets sleep pressure turn into sleep

Now we'll put all this information together to help you fix your sleep.

What Perfect Sleep Looks Like
=============================
Below I've listed my understanding of what a "perfect" sleep routine might look like based on the way our bodies work.

This is **not** realistic for most people. You **don't** have to do all of this. Most people - myself included - won't hit this perfect ideal because the sacrifices involved are just too extreme.

Instead, I'm giving this as a direction we can go towards. Afterwards, I'll break it down into something more realistic.

A "perfect" sleep routine:

**Morning**
- You sleep in a cool, dark, quiet room with windows that let in morning light at sunrise
- You wake around dawn naturally without an alarm clock, which is the same time you get up every day
- Rather than looking at phones or screens, you first go for a ~10 minute walk under the sky to tell your circadian clock "It's daytime" (and wake you up with some exercise)
- You might take a cold shower when you get back to increase your body temperature and wake you up
- You might go to the gym or do some other exercise to further raise your body temperature and wake yourself up
- When you get back you eat breakfast, further signalling to your circadian clock "It's daytime"

**During the day**
- You do not drink any caffeine or alcohol
- You do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sex
    - You do not work in your bed
    - You do not read in bed
    - You do not play with your phone, work, or watch TV
- As the post-lunch slump happens, you might take a nap of either 20 minutes or 1.5-2 hours (but not 20-90 minutes)

**Night**
- You eat a relatively early dinner, around sunset
- After sunset, 2-3 hours before bed, you...
    - Stop strenuous physical exercise
    - Don't eat any food
    - Disconnect from screens (phone, TV, computer, etc.) and the internet
    - Turn off overhead lights and only use dim, orange lights placed low in the room
    - Do a calming activity like reading, listening to a podcast, or listening to calming music
    - Might take a warm bath or shower
    - Might do some pen-and-paper journalling
- When you get in bed you...
    - Wear a sleep tracker so you can get an idea of your sleep duration and quality
    - Might wear earplugs or turn on a noise generator to block any sound that could wake you up
    - Consciously take deep, slow belly breaths to trigger your rest & digest nervous system
    - Keep your thoughts focused on a calm, soothing place (redirecting yourself back when you find yourself thinking, planning, or anticipating because your bed is only for sleep & sex - not for thinking)
- If you find yourself unable to sleep, you...
    - Might try the [military sleep method](https://sleepdoctor.com/how-sleep-works/military-sleep-method) to help yourself relax
    - Might get up and do a calming activity in the dark elsewhere in your house so that you're not using your bed for thinking
- If you wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep, you...
    - Do not turn on lights (e.g. no lights when using the bathroom)
    - Do not eat food
    - Might listen to some calming music, or a low-activation podcast or audiobook
- When you wake up you check your sleep tracker to see how your sleep was

### Naps & Sleep Stages
I mentioned above that you might take a nap of less than 20 minutes or greater than 90 minutes. To understand why, I'll explain what happens when we sleep:

During sleep, our body moves through [four different sleep stages](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/stages-of-sleep). Each has its own purpose:

1. **Transition Sleep:** The lightest stage, lasting 1-10 minutes. It's in between wakefulness and real sleep, and if you're woken up here you may not even know you were asleep. If you've ever been sleeping next to a partner and they twitched, that happened in this stage.
2. **Light Sleep:** A slightly deeper stage where breathing slows, muscles relax, and heart rate drops. If you're awakened here, you probably knew you were asleep.
3. **Deep Sleep:** The deepest sleep, and hardest to wake someone up from. This stage is mostly about body repair: your immune system works, your muscles repair, etc. If you're woken up during this stage, you'll feel slow and groggy. This is the stage where sleepwalking occurs.
4. **Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep:** This is a weird stage. Your eyes are sliding back and forth behind your eyelids (hence the name "rapid eye movement"), and your brain is active almost as if you're awake because you're having vivid dreams. However, your body has intentionally paralyzed itself to keep you from acting out your dreams. This stage's benefit is mostly mental: memory formation and emotional processing.

But our body doesn't just go Transition Sleep -> Light Sleep -> Deep Sleep -> REM Sleep -> wake up. 

Instead, our body moves through cycles of the four stages. It roughly looks like Transition Sleep -> Light Sleep -> Deep Sleep -> REM Sleep -> start again, but there can be some skipping around. Each cycle is [1.5-2 hours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/), and a normal night of sleep is composed of 4-5 cycles.

This means that there are better and worse times to wake up during the cycle. 

You might have experienced this in your own life when you wake up with alarms: sometimes, you feel better waking up after roughly 4 hours than you do after 5. This is likely because you woke up near the end of the cycle after 4 hours, whereas with 5 hours you'd have been better off waiting a little longer.

But each individual's sleep cycle length is different, and the cycle lengths change over the night. Meaning, it's very hard to wake yourself up at the perfect time using an alarm. Much easier is just to let yourself wake up naturally.

This is why naps should be less than 20 minutes or more 1.5-2 hours. Anything in the 20-90 minute range risks waking you up in Deep Sleep, meaning you're tired when you wake up.

The last note about naps: a nap's purpose is to refresh you, meaning reduce your sleep pressure (adenosine). If your nap is too long and too close to bedtime, you might clean _too much_ adenosine. It will then be hard to fall asleep at bedtime.





What Realistic Sleep Looks Like
===============================
I'll emphasize again: perfect sleep is unrealistic. I'm _never_ going to have a coffee? I'm _never_ going to stay up late with friends? It's not reasonable.

But that's okay because we don't need to be perfect. We just need to be good enough.

By my definition, "good enough" means you regularly experience all of the following without taking substances like caffeine or sleeping pills:

1. You wake up easily feeling refreshed and energized
2. Your mind feels clear and quick throughout the day
3. You fall asleep easily at the end of the day

### Good Enough
To get to "good enough", I try to gracefully relax the perfect ideal into something that I can actually maintain. Here's what I currently do in my own life:

- I sleep in a bedroom with a blackout shade over the window that I lower 80% of the way down, leaving 20% of the window uncovered so that the morning light will gradually wake me up
- I sleep with earplugs ([I recommend Mack's](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051U7W32)), as I live in a noisy city and [noise can decrease sleep quality even if it doesn't wake you up](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/noise-and-sleep) (I definitely notice that my sleep quality is worse without earplugs)
- I turn on the air conditioner whenever I feel warm, to maintain a cool environment
- I wake between 05:00 and 06:00 with [an alarm clock app that plays wave sounds](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep) - softly at first, and then getting louder over 5 minutes to pull me out of sleep more gradually
- I get out of bed as soon as my alarm goes off, and pull the blackout shades all the way up to let in full sunlight
- Depending on the day of the week, I then try to set my circadian clock with daylight and exercise:
    - Eat a banana, bike to the park, and do an hour of yoga or functional training
    - Go for a 10-minute walk around my neighborhood while listening to an audiobook or podcast
- When I get back I evaluate how much more alert I need to be and choose between a cold shower and a warm one
- I do mindfulness meditation for at least 10 minutes afterwards
- I then eat breakfast
- I might have a single cup of caffeinated coffee, so long as it's before ~10:30am and I'm okay experiencing the coffee crash and reduced sleep quality at night
    - I do this because even though I know it's best to have no coffee, I love coffee
    - The "before 10:30" rule is because my body processes caffeine slower than normal people due to my genetics, so caffeine stays in my system longer than most people
    - I do this only 1-2 days per week
    - When I do drink coffee, I have a noticeable crash in the late afternoon: I feel anxious, tired, and bad about life so I need to remember it's the coffee talking so that I don't make any drastic decisions
- When feeling tired throughout the day I occasionally lay on my bed to rest, though I'm trying to cut this habit so that my bed is strictly for sleep and sex
    - I never work or watch TV in bed
    - I sometimes play on my phone in bed, though it's a bad habit and I'm trying to stop
- If I feel tired in the afternoon I'll try to take a 20-minute nap
    - Rarely, if I know I'm going to be up late with friends, I'll take a 2-hour nap around 5-6pm (but this messes up my next days so I tend to avoid it)
- My last workout of the day ends in the early afternoon, by 4-5pm
- I try to finish dinner by ~7pm, though sometimes this gets stretched to 8pm
    - When I eat late, I notice a harder time falling asleep
- At 7:30pm I've configured [this Chrome browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-site-blocker/aoabjfoanlljmgnohepbkimcekolejjn) to block Youtube, Reddit, Instagram, and a news site I read, just in case I get caught in a scrolling spiral
    - I don't have my phone block Instagram because sometimes I want to post Stories of what I do after 7:30pm
    - This is less dangerous for me because I use (and highly recommend) [this modded version of Instagram](https://www.distractionfreeapps.com/) that disables the Feed and all the addictive crap on the Search page
- I also have apps on my phone and laptop that make my screen orange at night to block blue light:
    - On my phone, I use [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux)
    - On my laptop, I use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)
- Around 8:30pm I:
    - Turn off all lights in my apartment except for very dim ones that are low in the room
    - Take a warm shower
    - Stop all screens
    - Might do some journalling in my pen-and-paper journal about the day, focusing on the things that went right rather than the things that went wrong (to decrease my stress rather than increase it)
    - Might lay on my couch in the dark while listening to a low-stress audiobook
        - I find that books with useful information (e.g. business books) tend to be stressful, since I'm trying to pay attention and remember everything
        - The best books I've found for this are books where I say, "Huh that's interesting" but don't feel pressured to learn and apply a lesson
- Between 9:00 and 9:30pm I'll crawl into bed
    - I'm always wearing my [Fitbit Inspire 3](https://store.google.com/us/product/fitbit_inspire_3) to bed, which logs my sleep duration & quality overnight
    - As I lie in bed, I try to slow my breathing by 50% and think about a calming place
- At 22:30pm I have my phone and laptop configured to block certain apps, as an extra safety in case I get caught in a bad scrolling spiral
    - On my phone, I use [AppBlock](https://appblock.app/) to block Instagram and Discord
    - On my laptop I use [the Mac Downtime feature](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/manage-downtime-in-screen-time-mchl69510069/mac) to block everything except Notion, the app that I write in, Spotify, and ChatGPT
- I commonly catch myself in bed thinking about mistakes of the past, planning for the future, or trying to resolve a problem; when I catch this, I remind myself that my bed is not for thinking and try to redirect my thoughts back to a calm, neutral place
    - For me, this is a rock where I used to sit on the shore of a lake at a summer camp I used to go to as a child
- If I have to go to the bathroom, I do so in the dark
- If I'm still lying awake in bed after 20-30 minutes, I'll try the [military sleep method](https://sleepdoctor.com/how-sleep-works/military-sleep-method) to see if I can relax enough to sleep
- If I still can't sleep (usually because of food, exercise, or coffee earlier), or I wake up and can't get back to sleep, I'll get up and try to do something calming
    - For me, this is meditating, listening to calming music, or slow stretching
    - Sometimes I'll turn on a dim orange desk light and do pen-and-paper journalling
- When I wake up I check my sleep duration and quality in the Fitbit app
    - Very commonly, my duration is less than I thought

### Caffeine
Caffeine is so widespread that I wanted to share more information here so you know how to handle it.

As you now know, caffeine blocks your body's ability to notice sleep pressure (adenosine). It also activates your fight-or-flight nervous system.

When you drink or eat something with caffeine, nearly all the caffeine is in your blood by 45 minutes after consumption. From there, your body starts the slow process of eliminating the caffeine. For normal people, [half of the caffeine will be eliminated in 4-6 hours](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-half-life-of-caffeine). Some people process caffeine faster, and others (like me) process slower.

Caffeine is measured in milligrams (mg), and I find it useful to know the dose of some common items:

- Cup of green tea: 15mg
- Cup of black tea: 30mg
- Normal 355ml (12oz) soda: 30mg
- Single shot of espresso: 75mg
- 250ml (8oz) can of Red Bull energy drink: 80mg
- 250ml (8oz) cup of regular coffee: 80-100mg
- Cup of coffee at a chain like Starbucks: usually 90-180mg, more than normal coffee
- 16oz (450ml) can of Monster energy drink: 160mg
- Exercise preworkout: 175-300mg

You can find caffeine quantities anything else you can think of on [Caffeine Informer](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/).

An example: if you take 300mg of exercise preworkout at 8am, you'll still have 75mg of caffeine in your body 10 hours later at 6pm (300mg divided by 2 for the first 5 hours, and then divided by 2 again for the second 5 hours).

### Getting To Good Enough
As you make changes in your own life, it's important that you _take things slow_.

I'm a firm believer in "consistency over intensity". 

If you try to change everything all at once you'll feel excited at first. Then the changes will start to feel like a lot of work, and you'll begin to feel stressed. Eventually you'll procrastinate a little on what you're supposed to do. Eventually you'll quit, and you'll be back exactly where you started with no progress. 

So take it slow. Experiment with changing one thing per 1-2 weeks.

Put another way, you got your bad sleep habits through years of poor choices. You're not going to fix it in a week _and that's okay_.

To keep you motivated, I strongly recommend a sleep-tracking wearable. Just like in the gym, you can use it to help you see a link between the choices you make and results.

When you make a bad decision (which _will_ happen; it's okay!), you'll see the negative impact it has on your sleep and you'll be reminded to get back on track.


Specific Advice
===============
### I'm not tired when it's time for bed
There are quite a few things that could be causing this:

- You're drinking too much caffeine too close to bed which is preventing you from feeling sleep pressure and activating your fight-or-flight nervous system
    - SOLUTION: no caffeine after 11:00am
- You exercised too close to sleep and your body is still activated
    - SOLUTION: exercise in the morning or early afternoon
- You've been blasting your eyes with light at night so you don't have enough melatonin built up to sleep
    - SOLUTION: stop screens and overhead light 1-1.5h before the time you want to be in bed
- Your circadian clock isn't anchored on actual sunrise (perhaps due to jetlag, perhaps because you've been confusing it with light or eating at night)
    - SOLUTION: get 10+ minutes of daylight immediately upon waking and eat food after, and 2 hours before bedtime stop eating, overhead lights, and screens
- You're sleeping at different times each night, so your circadian clock doesn't have a consistent idea of nighttime that it can prepare you for
    - SOLUTION: get daylight right when you wake up to anchor your circadian clock, and go to bed at the same time each night
- Your fight-or-flight nervous system is still activated, preventing you from noticing sleep pressure
    - SOLUTION: do something calming: a guided meditation while laying quietly, calming music, pen-and-paper journalling, a peaceful audiobook, etc.
- You took too long of a nap too close to bedtime, so you don't have sufficient sleep pressure built up
    - SOLUTION: limit naps to TODO hours, and more than TODO hours before bed

### I go to bed, but I can't fall asleep
This is very likely your fight-or-flight nervous system keeping you alert because it thinks there's a threat you need to react to. 

Your body treats all stress the same, so your troubles at work or in your relationship are activating the same stress response as physical danger. Try to figure out what your mind is holding on to, and see if you can tell it, "There's nothing I can do about this right now. There's nothing to be done. We'll address this tomorrow." 

Sometimes, our mind is hanging on to something because it's afraid we'll forget it. It sometimes helps me to write the thing I'm worrying about in a place where I'll see it the next morning, so my mind trusts that I'll handle it later (credit to ["Getting Things Done"](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) for this trick). Often I have to do this a couple times, until my mind lets go of everything it was hanging on to.

Sometimes though, you just mess up. You ate, or exercised, or were on screens, or took coffee too close to bed. It's okay, it happens. 

It's important that you don't beat yourself up, or get freaked out about how tired you're going to be tomorrow, because then you're just activating your fight-or-flight nervous system and making it even harder to fall asleep. Just like a pilot coming in for a bad landing, just pull up and come around again. Get out of bed so that you're not using bed for thinking/stressing/worrying, and do something calming: writing, listening to podcast or audiobook, etc. Try again in 20-30 minutes, or when you feel tired again.

### I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep
People assume this is bad and get stressed out about it, making it harder to sleep again. But it's not necessarily bad!

There's decent evidence that before the invention of artificial lights, [humans slept in two phases with a brief awake period between them](TODO). Supposedly this middle-of-the-night awake time felt very calm and peaceful. Rarely, when I'm very well-rested, I've experienced something sort of like this. 

So don't worry; just do something calming to get back to sleep. And **definitely** don't turn on any lights!

### I wake up tired
This could be for several reasons:

- You didn't sleep long enough, meaning you didn't fully clear the adenosine/sleep pressure from the previous day
    - SOLUTON: make the conscious choice to prioritize sufficient sleep, remembering that days of heavy brain or body exertion require more rest
- You're waking up before your usual wakeup time and your body is still cold with low cortisol (e.g. you had to wake up early to catch a flight)
    - SOLUTION: get moving to warm your body up, though be conscious that light and food will pull your circadian clock's wake-up time earlier
- You're not sleeping on a regular schedule, and are instead getting 8 hours randomly.
    - SOLUTION:
- You have sleep apnea, which is causing micro-wakeups that are preventing you from getting restful sleep
    - SOLUTION: get a sleep tracker that monitors noise and oxygen levels, and see a doctor if you're hearing gasping or seeing your oxygen levels drop in the night
- Your room is too hot, causing micro-wakeups
    - SOLUTION: cool your room, preferably to ~20 Celsius/68 Fahrenheit
- Your partner is disturbing you as you sleep, causing micro-wakeups 
    - SOLUTION: consider a bigger bed, separate blankets, or a mattress with a foam that isolates movement
- Sounds are causing micro-wakeups
    - SOLUTION: get better sound isolating in your room, and consider earplugs

### I can't seem to keep a consistent bedtime
Several things to consider:

- Are you getting a strong blast of daylight as soon as you get up? This will help with falling asleep 14-16 hours later.
- Are you irradiating your eyes with light at night (screens, lights), suppressing melatonin production and making it difficult for you to sleep?
- Are you doing activating things (food, exercise, social media, videogames, etc.) before bed, making it harder to fall asleep?

### I'm flying east on an airplane and will be jetlagged
TODO
So for the purposes of jet lag, you want to:

1. Get bright overhead light exposure early in the day after waking up, to reinforce "I should be awake staring when the sun comes up".
2. Avoid bright light exposure in the evening so you don't confuse your clock.




Because you flew east, this is true jetlag: your body thinks it should still be sleeping at sunrise, and it thinks it should still be awake at night.

Before you go, you can start shifting your circadian clock to your destination. To do so:
- Start waking up at sunrise at your destination
- Turn on bright indoor lights as soon as you get up, to start adjusting your circadian clock earlier
- Eat yoru breakfast at the breakfast time of your destination
- Stop eating, exercise, screens etc. around sunset at your destination

You could also consider melatonin supplementation to help you fall asleep earlier, though I personally choose not to take it. I avoid drugs when possible.

When you arrive, you can do the same stuff from Good Enough sleep: get up around sunrise, go for walk, eat when you get back, etc.

Remember that your circadian clock can adjust by about 1 hour per day, so it's going to take some time to fully align with the local timezone.

### I'm flying west on an airplane and will be jetlagged
This type of jetlag is easier and faster to fix. Basically, you just need to stay up via caffeine, exercise, etc. You're going to build a tremendous amount of sleep pressure from staying up so long, so it should be easy to fall asleep as long as you're not suppressing melatonin production by receiving light near bedtime.

### I'm sleep deprived; now what?
The first thing to remember is that you're not thinking straight. You're more anxious, more depressed, more negative, and more fearful. This can lead to reactive decisions about your life, job, or relationships that wouldn't be a big deal if you were well-rested.

I like to remind myself, "No judgments about my life until the dark circles are gone from under my eyes."

Second, you're going to want to reach for your stimulant of choice (probably caffeine) to help you get through the tiredness. It's very important you resist this urge! If you take the stimulant, you'll mess up your sleep that night, which means you won't get better.

If it helps, you can think about it as: you took out a sleep loan from the back in the past. Now you have to pay it back. Be more careful taking out that sleep loan in the future.

Third, remember that your tiredness will make you want to reach for "easy" dopamine: social media, Youtube, Netflix, etc. It's especially important you avoid this entertainment because your defenses are down so you're more likely to get into a bad spiral, and the screens will mess up your sleep. If you mess up your sleep, you'll never get better.

Instead, contemplate doing some journalling, meditation, or listening to an audiobook.

### What about white noise?
I personally use noise to help block out any sounds my earplugs don't catch. Noises come in various "colors", and I find white noise to be pretty harsh. I like brown noise better, so I [have an app that I use](TODO).

### Should I take melatonin supplementation?
I've used melatonin in the past to help when I need to sleep on airplanes and when flying west -> east. These days I try to minimize the substances I take to avoid unexpected side effects, and the Andrew Huberman podcast on sleep seems to suggest that we're still figuring out melatonin supplementation's full effects.

### What about supplements like magnesium?
I don't personally supplement magnesium, but the Andrew Huberman podcast on sleep suggests that magnesium threonine is particularly effective in helping relax and fall asleep.

Fun Sleep Facts
===============
### Glymphatic System
Your brain cells contract when you sleep. This opens up channels between the brain cells which are used for flushing away cellular waste, like sewers. This is called your **glymphatic system**. When you don't get enough sleep, it's like your brain cells keep producing garbage but the garbage truck never comes. The trash just keeps accumulating.

### Circadian Rhythm Isn't Exactly 24h
TODO your circadian rhythm is not naturally 24h! It's actually a little bit wrong, so light is necessary to keep it on track (also important for seasons)
TODO cite study where dude stayed down in cave, and the circadian rhythm extended longer to 26h

### Biphasic Sleep
TODO

### Why Does The Post-Lunch Tiredness Happen?
TODO Why does it happen?

### Dreaming
- You may not think you dream but you do; you just don't remember it
- You only remember dreams you awake in the middle of

### Deep Sleep vs REM Sleep %
TODO Interestingly, each cycle is a bit different. Your first cycle will spend a lot of time in Deep Sleep fixing your body, and not much time in REM Sleep fixing your mind. As the night progresses, your Deep Sleep stages get shorter and your REM Sleep stages get longer.

Fundamentals: Understanding Your Body
=====================================
To fix your sleep problems, I need to teach you some important things about how your body works.

### Two Nervous Systems
You have two opposing nervous systems:

1. **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS):** This is your "fight or flight" nervous system. It's responsible for alertness, attention focus, and the stress response. It releases adrenaline during dangerous or high-energy activities such as fighting or sports, and also cortisol during longer periods of stress.
2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS):** This is your "rest and digest" nervous system. It's responsible for relaxation, metabolism, and energy conservation. When engaged, it turns off the stress response and brings us back to a calm place so digestion can occur. 

To remember the difference, think:

- Sympathetic nervous system is "sympathetic" to your danger
- "parar" in Spanish/Portuguese means "to stop"; the parasympathetic nervous system is all about stopping and relaxing

### The Sympathetic Is Stronger
The sympathetic nervous system is faster and stronger than parasympathetic nervous system. You can shoot to 100% stress level in seconds, but it will take hours to come back down.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: if you're getting chased by a tiger, running away is far more important than sleeping or digestion - even if you're very tired.

This means that it's possible to get into chronic stress states where the sympathetic nervous system is dominating. It's like you're "hooked" in a high-stress state, seemingly unable to come down.

### There's Only One Type Of Stress
Your sympathetic nervous system doesn't distinguish between physical vs psychological stressors. All of these are handled the same:

- A tiger chasing you
- A work deadline
- A stressful videogame
- Financial debt
- An aggressive person on the street at night
- Failing an exam
- Your partner arguing with you
- Feeling inadequate comparing oneself to others on social media
- Feeling socially rejected

### The Sympathetic Grabs Focus, But Too Much Is Bad
The sympathetic nervous system grabs our attention. You've felt this any time you've:

- Been in a dangerous situation
- Been involved in a tricky merge while driving, and you don't hear what your passenger is saying
- Been locked in to meet a very tight deadline

In these situations, the SNS grabbing focus is a good thing.

However, the SNS's attention-grabbing power can be disruptive when it's too active for too long:

- You're trying to read but your attention is constantly yanked back to the argument you had with your partner
- You're anxious, constantly scanning for danger
- Social media notifications constantly interrupt your focus, making you unproductive at work

### The Circadian Clock
Your body has an internal clock that tells your body when to start feeling sleepy and when to wake up. 

It works via cortisol and melatonin.

It works by hormone release, and body temperature.

High body temperature


- High temperature = energy, reaction time, physical performance
- Low temperature = sleepiness
- Darkness = "it's nighttime" = produce melatonin
- Body temperature rises in morning, peaks in afternoon, drops at night
- Warm showers cool by increasing blood flow to skin, which accelerates heat loss when you get out
- Sudden cold = wakefulness (via SNS activation, increases body temperature via brown fat activation)
- Gradual cold (cold room) = helps sleepiness by gradual heat loss
- Bright light (especially blue light) = "it's daytime" = suppress melatonin production, shift your circadian rhythm
- Sleepiness starts 12-16 hours after waking up
- Temporary dip 7-9 hours after waking
- Cortisol (circadian alerting signal) peaks in the morning

- Exercise in morning/afternoon raise body temperature, promote wakefulness
- Exercise at night raises body temperature, makes it harder to fall asleep

To start feeling sleepy, your body temperature 

When it's time to fall asleep, your body starts releasing melatonin

The clock is adjustable 

This clock is adjusted by exposing your eyes to light. Bright morning/sunrise light = "stay awake". Dim,

Specifically,  TODOOOOOOOOOOOOO

### Light
- Light + seratonin = wakefulness
- Darkness + seratonin = melatonin

### Eating & Sleep
- Liver & gut have peripheral clocks
- Morning meals signal "daytime" = alertness
- Fasting & high-protein meals promote wakefulness
- Eating too close to bed raises body temperature (delaying sleep) and messing with liver & gut clocks

### Adenosine & Sleep Pressure
- Adenosine the result of brain using energy
- Accumulates while you're awake
- Sufficient sleep clears adenosine and resets wakefulness
- If you don't sleep enough, adenosine is high the next day (tiredness)

### Social Interaction
Social engagement and cognitive tasks increase dopamine, norepinephrine, and orexin, keeping you alert.

How it Affects Wakefulness:
- Isolation or lack of stimulation can increase drowsiness.
- Engaging in conversation, learning, or problem-solving keeps the brain awake.

TODO Dopamine increases wakefulness!

I used to be like these people. **I believe this is exceedingly dangerous.**

### My Story
It was the end of 2023, and I was 32. I'd been grinding hard on my startup, sleeping an average 6h40m per night for over a year. I was deeply stressed, and I began to experience inexplicable medical symptoms: 

Sentences didn't make sense unless I read them 2-3 times. My speech wasn't completely under my control, with words getting substituted  (e.g. wanting to say "New Year" but "New York" came out instead). My hands were trembling slightly, and "w"s and "m"s were particularly difficult to write. My vision was trembling slightly, as if the world was having a very minor earthquake. My balance was affected, as if I were on a very slightly moving ship. It was difficult to remember things from a few days ago.

I visited several doctors, including two neurologists. I got tested for multiple sclerosis. Everything came back negative. Nobody could explain what was wrong with me beyond "stress".

I took a month off work as a last resort. Finally... the symptoms started to ease.

It's 2025 as I write this, and I'm mostly back to normal. My hands, memory, and reading comprehension returned. However, I'm not completely fixed. My balance and vision are still slightly wobbly, and my speech still feels awkward at times.

### Aftermath
As I told my burnout story to others in the months that followed, people began to tell me theirs. Crazy stuff: one friend with partial facial paralysis, another with autoimmune-like attacks in her digestive system, another with anxiety attacks.

In all stories, the person's sleep is shit.

I'm not a sleep researcher, but it seems staggeringly clear that sleep is our body's maintenance. If we skip it, our bodies fall apart in basically every way possible:

- [Lack of sleep is increasingly being linked to Alheimzer's and dementia](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/lack-sleep-may-be-linked-risk-factor-alzheimers-disease)
- [Lack of sleep is strongly linked to depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16259539/)
- [Lack of sleep is linked to anxiety as well as depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814343/)
- [Lack of sleep harms athletic performance, reducing performance, reducing muscle recovery, and increasing injury risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960533/#S13)
- [Lack of sleep is linked to diabetes & obesity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929315/)
- [Lack of sleep makes you feel worse, and reduces your ability to emotionally regulate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193556/)
- [Lack of sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565718/)
- [Lack of sleep damages your ability to form memories, including your immune system's "memory" of pathogens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3768102/)
- [Lack of sleep reduces testosterone in males](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijsem/international-journal-of-sports-and-exercise-medicine-ijsem-6-169.php)

As if that's not enough, consider the secondary effects of sleep deprivation you've experienced in your own life:

- Unhealthy sugary, fatty food are more appealing than healthy foods
- Working out is harder, and you're more likely to skip it
- You're more likely to react angrily to irritations, leading to outbursts you have to mend later
- You're not efficient in your work
- You're more likely to keep drinking
- **You're more likely to stay up late doing passive consumption activities like Netflix or social media, thereby making you more tired**

It's not at all surprising that I, and the people I talked to, started to fall apart. **Sleep deprivation is poison!**

Here's the craziest part though:
