I'd wrestled with insomnia for most of my life. It's now mostly solved. This article condenses my experience so you can fix yours, and explains why it's important to do so.

This will be useful if you:

- Vaguely know you "should" fix your sleep, but it doesn't feel a priority to do so
- Aren't tired when it's time for bed
- Lie in bed unable to fall asleep because your mind is racing
- Wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep
- Can't seem to keep a consistent bedtime

<!--
You're going to be interested in this guide if you:

- You know sleep is important, but you can't seem to prioritize it
- Need to optimize your performance (as an entrepreneur, athlete, etc.)
- Can't fall asleep because your mind is racing
- Know you're supposed to go to bed, but you're not tired
- Wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep
- Can't keep a consistent bedtime & wake-up time
-->

Why Bother?
===========
We know we "should" fix our sleep. Yet we're blasted with information discouraging us from sleeping:

- Entrepreneurs on Instagram talking about their "grindset", and how little they sleep
- "I'll sleep when I'm dead" 
- "Sleep is for the weak"
- "Live fast, die young, leave a pretty corpse"
- "You Only Live Once (YOLO)"
- Party music encouraging us to "dance until the sun comes up"
- The famous "sleep faster" video from Arnold Schwarzeneggar
- People like Jocko Willink who claim they only need 4h of sleep, making us think "Maybe I could do that too?"

When this is what we consume, of course staying awake is the path we choose.

But you need to know: **sleep deprivation is poison for every system in your body.**

The science is very clear: if you are sleep-deprived, you are...

- [Destroying your mental performance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2656292)
- [Making yourself depressed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16259539/)
- [Making yourself anxious](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814343/)
- [Damaging your athletic performance, reducing muscle recovery, and increasing injury risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960533/#S13)
- [Progressing towards Alheimzer's and dementia](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/lack-sleep-may-be-linked-risk-factor-alzheimers-disease)
- [Increasing obesity and progressing towards diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929315/)
- [Making yourself feel bad, reducing your ability to emotionally regulate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193556/)
- [Increasing the chance you have a heart attack](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565718/)
- [Damaging your ability to form memories, including your immune system's "memory" of pathogens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3768102/)
- [Reducing your testosterone](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijsem/international-journal-of-sports-and-exercise-medicine-ijsem-6-169.php)

If you're not the science type, consider the effects you've undoubtedly already experienced:

- Unhealthy sugary, fatty food are more appealing than healthy foods
- Working out is harder, and you're more likely to skip it
- You're more likely to react angrily to irritations, leading to outbursts you have to fix later
- You're slow and inefficient in your work, thereby forcing you to work more
- You're more likely to favor short-term gratification (e.g. keep drinking)
- **You're more likely to stay up late doing passive consumption activities like Netflix or social media, thereby making you more tired**

Notice this last one. Sleep deprivation poisons with vicious cycles: if you get a little sleep deprived, it tends to lead to more sleep deprivation.

So here's me sounding the emergency: **if you're sleep deprived (which I can almost guarantee you are), you are destroying yourself**.

Now the good news:

Suppose I tell you I have [the miracle drug from "Limitless"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(film)), and it also increases your athletic performance, and _also_ reduces your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's, anxiety, and depression.

Wouldn't you do a _lot_ to get that drug? Turns out that it exists, it's free, and it can be found in your bedroom. 

You can basically become superhuman by getting sufficient rest.

Understanding How Sleep Works
=============================
So how do we fix your sleep problems? First it's _very_ important that you understand how sleep works.

If you're feeling impatient ("Just tell me what to do!"), know that understanding _why_ and _how_ your body works is crucial to making long-term changes. 

If you don't understand how you work, you're not going to be able to self-diagnose and resolve the sleep problems you hit in the future.

We'll cover five things:

1. Your two nervous systems
2. The chemical that makes you tired, adenosine
3. Your circadian clock
4. How to adjust your circadian clock
5. Melatonin

### Two Nervous Systems
Your body has two nervous systems:

1. **Fight-or-flight:** This activates during stressful situations, and is responsible for the release of adrenaline and cortisol. Think running away from a tiger: rapid breathing, pounding heart, wired muscles, intense focus.
2. **Rest and digest:** This turns off the fight-or-flight nervous system. Think calm, peace, relaxed muscles, sex, and **sleep**.

Importantly, _your body does not distinguish between types of stress_. 

A tiger attack, a cold shower, an argument with your romantic partner, and social anxiety from Instagram are all handled the same: your fight-or-flight nervous system gets activated. What changes is the degree of fight-or-flight activation.

Regardless of the cause, if your fight-or-flight system is activated then you're going to have a hard time falling asleep because your body is prepped to respond to stress.

### Adenosine
While you are awake and using energy, a chemical byproduct called "adenosine" is produced. Adenosine is a tiredness chemical: the more it builds up in your brain, the more "sleep pressure" you experience and the more tired you feel. 

Think of it like brakes for your brain: the harder your brain works, the more adenosine, the more your brain needs to slow down to do maintenance so it doesn't damage itself.

If you're living a clean life, you get tired near the end of the day, you sleep, your brain does maintenance, and the adenosine is cleaned out during sleep leaving you refreshed in the morning.

However, if you're not sleeping enough then you don't clear all the adenosine from your brain during sleep. You wake up tired and slow due to leftover adenosine. You have "sleep debt".

Things get worse with caffeine.

Caffeine blocks our brain from noticing adenosine, temporarily masking sleep pressure. You can't fall asleep when you've taken caffeine too close to bed because your body doesn't think it needs to sleep.

If you've ever had a caffeine crash, it's because adenosine has been steadily building but your brain didn't notice it due to caffeine's effects. When the caffeine wears off, your brain suddenly notices all the adenosine and you crash.

### The Circadian Clock
You've probably heard of your circadian rhythm, but what exactly is it?

Your brain has a little clock above the roof of your mouth that tracks when it thinks day and night are. It tries to make you alert at the start of the day, and sleepy 14-16 hours later.

It does this through two mechanisms. 

The first is body temperature. The higher your body temperature, the more alert and energized you are. The lower your body temperature, the sleepier and more sedentary.

When you sleep, your body temperature is low. As you wake up, your circadian clock triggers a body temperature increase and you feel energized.

As the day goes on:

1. You experience a body temperature peak (and feel most energized) around 3-4 hours after waking. You might have noticed this as mid-morning productivity.
1. You get a small temperature dip around 5-6 hours after waking, which you might recognize as the post-lunch slump (but which occurs _even if_ you don't eat lunch).
1. You get another peak around 10-12 hours after waking, which you might recognize as late afternoon productivity.
1. Your body temperature steadily declines from there, making you slow and sleepy.

You'll see this is true if you think to your own life:

- It's hard to sleep in a hot room because your body temperature can't drop the way it wants to.
- The reason it's so hard to wake up in the middle of the night to catch a flight is because your body is still cold and sleepy (and you likely haven't cleared all the adenosine from the day before).
- Cold showers and cold plunges wake you up because your body temperature needs to spike to keep you warm (and because your fight-or-flight nervous system activates).
- Exercising right before bed makes it hard to sleep because the activity artificially elevates your body temperature. It takes a couple hours for your temperature to come back down.
- Taking a warm shower or bath before bed helps you sleep because your body works to shed heat, which causes a body temperature drop when you get out.

The second way your circadian clock tries to keep you awake for 14-16 hours is cortisol.

Cortisol is a hormone that enhances alertness, counteracting the sleep pressure from adenosine. It's the same hormone produced by your fight-or-flight nervous system to keep you alert when your body is responding to stress. Cortisol itself is _not_ a bad thing; it's only bad when you're constantly flooded with too much.

Your circadian clock peaks your cortisol levels ~30-45 minutes after awakening, and then lets them decline over the rest of the day (allowing you to feel more sleep pressure). They hit their lowest levels during the first half of sleep, and then increase in the second half back to the peak after waking.

Caffeine also has an effect here. In addition to blocking your brain from noticing adenosine and sleep pressure, caffeine stimulates your fight-or-flight nervous system to produce cortisol. This artificially increases your wakefulness.

This identical to why can't fall asleep when you're feeling stressed: your fight-or-flight nervous system is producing cortisol, masking the sleep pressure from adenosine that you're feeling.

### Setting Your Circadian Clock
If you've ever taken a long flight going east, you've likely been hit by jet lag. You can't sleep when it's night, and you wake up at odd times.

Jet lag is when your circadian clock's idea of day and night don't match actual day and night. Those body temperature and cortisol peaks we just talked about are happening at the wrong times (e.g. in the middle of the actual night, instead of right after waking).

Fortunately, our circadian clock's idea of day & night can be adjusted.

Adjustment happens through two main methods: light and food.

First, light: you have cells in the back of your eye that measure the intensity of light you're seeing. These cells will constrict your pupil, and they also train your circadian clock. Bright light exposure - and particularly blue light - hint to your circadian clock, "It is daytime; adjust yourself accordingly."

For the purposes of jet lag, 

1. Getting bright light exposure early in the day after waking up, to reinforce "I should be awake staring when the sun comes up".
2. Avoiding bright light exposure in the evening so you don't confuse your clock.

Artificial lights at night are clearly problematic: if we're getting exposed at night to the lights in our house, TVs, phones, or computers, we're telling our circadian clock, "It's daytime - shift yourself so that I'm awake during this hour.

The second way your circadian clock adjusts is through food.

When you eat, you're telling your circadian clock, "Food is available during this period, so adjust yourself so I'm awake during this time."

I couldn't find a definitive reason why, but this makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. In the ancient environment, food was much harder to find than it is today and ancient humans needed to adapt themselves to be alert when their prey was around. If the deer you normally eat only comes out at night, it makes sense that you're more awake at night.

The result is that if you eat food close to bed, you're telling your circadian clock, "Shift yourself to be awake during this time."

For the purposes of jet lag, you should eat on the meal schedules of the time zone you're on.

### Melatonin
The final piece to understand is melatonin. 

Adenosine and sleep pressure make you feel tired, but melatonin is what lets that tiredness turn into sleep. It does _not_ directly force you to sleep like a medication, but instead lowers body temperature, reduces cortisol keeping you awake, and lets sleep pressure result in sleep.

Your body produces melatonin in the darkness, and light exposure blocks melatonin production.

Therefore, artificial lights at night are doubly bad: you're incorrectly telling your circadian clock "You should be adjusting to think now is daytime," and you're preventing your ability to go to sleep.

You might have experienced this in your own life, after a late-night videogaming, TV, or phone session. Even though you're very tired (adenosine, sleep pressure), you can't fall asleep because your melatonin production has been impaired.

### Review
And that's what you need to know! 

To review:

- You have two nervous systems, a fight-or-flight one for stress and a rest & digest one for calm and sleep
- There's only one type of stress, your fight-or-flight nervous system produces cortisol as a result, and that cortisol keeps you awake
- Adenosine builds up as your awake, resulting in you feeling tired
- You have a biological clock that regulates your wakefulness and sleepiness with body temperature and cortisol
- Your biological clock gets set by light exposure and eating
- Melatonin lets sleep pressure turn into sleep

We'll next use all this information in the next session to fix your sleep.

What Perfect Looks Like
=======================
Putting all the information above together, this is my understanding of what a "perfect" sleep routine might look like:

- You sleep in a cool, dark, quiet room that can let morning light in when you rise
- You wake around dawn, naturally, without an alarm clock, which is the same time you get up every day
- You might take a cold shower
- Rather than looking at phones or screens, you get up and take a ~10 minutes to anchor your circadian clock with sunlight exposure as well, and wake up with some exercise
- When you get back you eat breakfast, further signalling to your circadian clock that now is a good time to be awake
- You do not take any caffeine
- Throughout the day, you do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sex; all your work is done elsewhere
    - You do not play with your phone, work, watch TV, or do anything else in your bed
- As the post-lunch slump happens, you might take a short nap
- After sunset, 1-2 hours before bed, you...
    - Stop strenuous physical exercise
    - Stop food intake
    - Disconnect from screens and the internet: phone, TV, computer
    - Dim artificial lights
    - Do a low-activation activity like reading, listening to a podcast, or listening to calming music
    - Might take a warm bath or shower
- When you get in bed you...
    - Wear a sleep tracker so you can get an idea of your actual sleep quality and duration
    - Slow your breathing down, triggering your rest & digest nervous system
    - Keep your thoughts centered on a calm, soothing place, redirecting yourself back when you find yourself thinking, planning, or anticipating (as your bed is only for sleep & sex, not for thinking)
- If you find yourself unable to sleep, you...
    - Might try the [military sleep method](https://sleepdoctor.com/how-sleep-works/military-sleep-method) to relax to the point of falling asleep
    - Might get up and do a calming activity in the dark elsewhere in your house so that you're not using your bed for thinking or planning

All that said, you're **not** going to hit this and _that's okay_. You don't need to; this isn't an exact science. You just need to be good enough so that you consistently feel good.

Tactics
=======
- Military sleep method
- Laying on sofa, in the dark, listening to podcast or audiobook
- Don't exercise 2-3h before bed
- No food 2-3h before bed
- No social interaction (esp social media!!!) before bed
- Fitbit sleep tracker, so you can see how you sleep
- Bed is ONLY for sleep & sex
    - NOT thinking, not watching TV, not messing with your phone, not Netflix
    - When mind is racing, get up and go lay on the couch

NOTE: 

What Perfect Looks Like
=======================
NOTE: obviously, perfect isn't sustainable. You're going to break some of these rules; it's fine. You just need to be Good Enough, to get good sleep.


Self-Help
=========
### I'm not tired when it's time for bed
- Could be that you're messing up your circadian cycle:
    - Bright lights at night
    - Screens at night
    - Not getting sufficient bright light right after you wake up
- Could be that your body temperature is artificially high
    - You're exercising close to sleep
    - You're eating close to bed

### I go to bed, but I can't switch my brain off
TODO why is your mind racing?

### I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep

### I wake up tired

### I can't seem to keep a consistent bedtime
- Probably you're messing up your circadian cycle:
    - Bright lights at night
    - Screens at night
    - Not getting sufficient bright light right after you wake up

### I flew east on an airplane and now I'm jetlagged

### I flew west on an airplane and now I'm "jetlagged"

### I'm sleep deprived; now what?
TODO no judgments on your life until the bags/circles under your eyes are gone


TODO stimulants: caffeine, methamphetamines, modafinil, cocaine


Fun Sleep Facts
===============
### Glymphatic System
Your brain contract when you sleep, opening up channels between the brain cells which are used for flushing away cellular waste. This is called your **glymphatic system**. When you don't get enough sleep, it's like your brain cells keep producing garbage but the garbage truck never comes. The trash just keeps accumulating.

### Circadian Rhythm Isn't Exactly 24h
TODO your circadian rhythm is not naturally 24h! It's actually a little bit wrong, so light is necessary to keep it on track (also important for seasons)
TODO cite study where dude stayed down in cave, and the circadian rhythm extended longer to 26h

- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8911243/ (GREAT overview of how the clocks work)











What to do about this
---------------------
- TODO do exercise early, but not late in the day
- TODO do warm-ups before exercising to help raise your body temperature!


TODO normal mg of caffeine of coffee, red bull, monster, etc.

TODO "don't judge your life until the bags under your life are gone"

Fundamentals: Understanding Your Body
=====================================
To fix your sleep problems, I need to teach you some important things about how your body works.

### Two Nervous Systems
You have two opposing nervous systems:

1. **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS):** This is your "fight or flight" nervous system. It's responsible for alertness, attention focus, and the stress response. It releases adrenaline during dangerous or high-energy activities such as fighting or sports, and also cortisol during longer periods of stress.
2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS):** This is your "rest and digest" nervous system. It's responsible for relaxation, metabolism, and energy conservation. When engaged, it turns off the stress response and brings us back to a calm place so digestion can occur. 

To remember the difference, think:

- Sympathetic nervous system is "sympathetic" to your danger
- "parar" in Spanish/Portuguese means "to stop"; the parasympathetic nervous system is all about stopping and relaxing

### The Sympathetic Is Stronger
The sympathetic nervous system is faster and stronger than parasympathetic nervous system. You can shoot to 100% stress level in seconds, but it will take hours to come back down.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: if you're getting chased by a tiger, running away is far more important than sleeping or digestion - even if you're very tired.

This means that it's possible to get into chronic stress states where the sympathetic nervous system is dominating. It's like you're "hooked" in a high-stress state, seemingly unable to come down.

### There's Only One Type Of Stress
Your sympathetic nervous system doesn't distinguish between physical vs psychological stressors. All of these are handled the same:

- A tiger chasing you
- A work deadline
- A stressful videogame
- Financial debt
- An aggressive person on the street at night
- Failing an exam
- Your partner arguing with you
- Feeling inadequate comparing oneself to others on social media
- Feeling socially rejected

### The Sympathetic Grabs Focus, But Too Much Is Bad
The sympathetic nervous system grabs our attention. You've felt this any time you've:

- Been in a dangerous situation
- Been involved in a tricky merge while driving, and you don't hear what your passenger is saying
- Been locked in to meet a very tight deadline

In these situations, the SNS grabbing focus is a good thing.

However, the SNS's attention-grabbing power can be disruptive when it's too active for too long:

- You're trying to read but your attention is constantly yanked back to the argument you had with your partner
- You're anxious, constantly scanning for danger
- Social media notifications constantly interrupt your focus, making you unproductive at work

### The Circadian Clock
Your body has an internal clock that tells your body when to start feeling sleepy and when to wake up. 

It works via cortisol and melatonin.

It works by hormone release, and body temperature.

High body temperature


- High temperature = energy, reaction time, physical performance
- Low temperature = sleepiness
- Darkness = "it's nighttime" = produce melatonin
- Body temperature rises in morning, peaks in afternoon, drops at night
- Warm showers cool by increasing blood flow to skin, which accelerates heat loss when you get out
- Sudden cold = wakefulness (via SNS activation, increases body temperature via brown fat activation)
- Gradual cold (cold room) = helps sleepiness by gradual heat loss
- Bright light (especially blue light) = "it's daytime" = suppress melatonin production, shift your circadian rhythm
- Sleepiness starts 12-16 hours after waking up
- Temporary dip 7-9 hours after waking
- Cortisol (circadian alerting signal) peaks in the morning

- Exercise in morning/afternoon raise body temperature, promote wakefulness
- Exercise at night raises body temperature, makes it harder to fall asleep

To start feeling sleepy, your body temperature 

When it's time to fall asleep, your body starts releasing melatonin

The clock is adjustable 

This clock is adjusted by exposing your eyes to light. Bright morning/sunrise light = "stay awake". Dim,

Specifically,  TODOOOOOOOOOOOOO

### Light
- Light + seratonin = wakefulness
- Darkness + seratonin = melatonin

### Eating & Sleep
- Liver & gut have peripheral clocks
- Morning meals signal "daytime" = alertness
- Fasting & high-protein meals promote wakefulness
- Eating too close to bed raises body temperature (delaying sleep) and messing with liver & gut clocks

### Adenosine & Sleep Pressure
- Adenosine the result of brain using energy
- Accumulates while you're awake
- Sufficient sleep clears adenosine and resets wakefulness
- If you don't sleep enough, adenosine is high the next day (tiredness)

### Social Interaction
Social engagement and cognitive tasks increase dopamine, norepinephrine, and orexin, keeping you alert.

How it Affects Wakefulness:
- Isolation or lack of stimulation can increase drowsiness.
- Engaging in conversation, learning, or problem-solving keeps the brain awake.

TODO Dopamine increases wakefulness!

I used to be like these people. **I believe this is exceedingly dangerous.**

### My Story
It was the end of 2023, and I was 32. I'd been grinding hard on my startup, sleeping an average 6h40m per night for over a year. I was deeply stressed, and I began to experience inexplicable medical symptoms: 

Sentences didn't make sense unless I read them 2-3 times. My speech wasn't completely under my control, with words getting substituted  (e.g. wanting to say "New Year" but "New York" came out instead). My hands were trembling slightly, and "w"s and "m"s were particularly difficult to write. My vision was trembling slightly, as if the world was having a very minor earthquake. My balance was affected, as if I were on a very slightly moving ship. It was difficult to remember things from a few days ago.

I visited several doctors, including two neurologists. I got tested for multiple sclerosis. Everything came back negative. Nobody could explain what was wrong with me beyond "stress".

I took a month off work as a last resort. Finally... the symptoms started to ease.

It's 2025 as I write this, and I'm mostly back to normal. My hands, memory, and reading comprehension returned. However, I'm not completely fixed. My balance and vision are still slightly wobbly, and my speech still feels awkward at times.

### Aftermath
As I told my burnout story to others in the months that followed, people began to tell me theirs. Crazy stuff: one friend with partial facial paralysis, another with autoimmune-like attacks in her digestive system, another with anxiety attacks.

In all stories, the person's sleep is shit.

I'm not a sleep researcher, but it seems staggeringly clear that sleep is our body's maintenance. If we skip it, our bodies fall apart in basically every way possible:

- [Lack of sleep is increasingly being linked to Alheimzer's and dementia](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/lack-sleep-may-be-linked-risk-factor-alzheimers-disease)
- [Lack of sleep is strongly linked to depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16259539/)
- [Lack of sleep is linked to anxiety as well as depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814343/)
- [Lack of sleep harms athletic performance, reducing performance, reducing muscle recovery, and increasing injury risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960533/#S13)
- [Lack of sleep is linked to diabetes & obesity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929315/)
- [Lack of sleep makes you feel worse, and reduces your ability to emotionally regulate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193556/)
- [Lack of sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565718/)
- [Lack of sleep damages your ability to form memories, including your immune system's "memory" of pathogens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3768102/)
- [Lack of sleep reduces testosterone in males](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijsem/international-journal-of-sports-and-exercise-medicine-ijsem-6-169.php)

As if that's not enough, consider the secondary effects of sleep deprivation you've experienced in your own life:

- Unhealthy sugary, fatty food are more appealing than healthy foods
- Working out is harder, and you're more likely to skip it
- You're more likely to react angrily to irritations, leading to outbursts you have to mend later
- You're not efficient in your work
- You're more likely to keep drinking
- **You're more likely to stay up late doing passive consumption activities like Netflix or social media, thereby making you more tired**

It's not at all surprising that I, and the people I talked to, started to fall apart. **Sleep deprivation is poison!**

Here's the craziest part though:
