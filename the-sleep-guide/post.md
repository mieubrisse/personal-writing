I'd wrestled with insomnia for most of my life. It's now mostly solved. This article is a practical guide on how you can fix yours, and why it's important to do so.

<!--
You're going to be interested in this guide if you:

- You know sleep is important, but you can't seem to prioritize it
- Need to optimize your performance (as an entrepreneur, athlete, etc.)
- Can't fall asleep because your mind is racing
- Know you're supposed to go to bed, but you're not tired
- Wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep
- Can't keep a consistent bedtime & wake-up time

Why Bother?
===========
We know we "should" fix our sleep. Yet we're blasted with information encouraging us not to sleep:

- Entrepreneurs on Instagram talking about their "grindset", and how little they sleep
- "I'll sleep when I'm dead" 
- "Sleep is for the weak"
- "Live fast, die young, leave a pretty corpse"
- YOLO
- Party music encouraging us to "dance until the sun comes up"
- The famous "sleep faster" video from Arnold Schwarzeneggar
- People like Jocko Willink who claim they only need 4h of sleep, making us think "Maybe I could do that too?"

When this is what we consume, of course staying awake is the path we choose.

But you need to know: **sleep deprivation is poison for every system in your body.**

The science is very clear: if you are sleep-deprived, you are...

- [Destroying your mental performance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2656292)
- [Making yourself depressed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16259539/)
- [Making yourself anxious](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814343/)
- [Damaging your athletic performance, reducing muscle recovery, and increasing injury risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960533/#S13)
- [Progressing towards Alheimzer's and dementia](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/lack-sleep-may-be-linked-risk-factor-alzheimers-disease)
- [Increasing obesity and progressing towards diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929315/)
- [Making yourself feel bad, reducing your ability to emotionally regulate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193556/)
- [Increasing the chance you have a heart attack](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565718/)
- [Damaging your ability to form memories, including your immune system's "memory" of pathogens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3768102/)
- [Reducing your testosterone](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijsem/international-journal-of-sports-and-exercise-medicine-ijsem-6-169.php)

If you're not the science type, consider the effects you've undoubtedly already experienced:

- Unhealthy sugary, fatty food are more appealing than healthy foods
- Working out is harder, and you're more likely to skip it
- You're more likely to react angrily to irritations, leading to outbursts you have to fix later
- You're slow and inefficient in your work, thereby forcing you to work more
- You're more likely to favor short-term gratification (e.g. keep drinking)
- **You're more likely to stay up late doing passive consumption activities like Netflix or social media, thereby making you more tired**

Notice this last one. Sleep deprivation poisons with vicious cycles: if you get a little sleep deprived, it tends to lead to more sleep deprivation.

So here's your alarm: if you're sleep deprived (which I can almost guarantee you are), you _are_ destroying yourself.

Now the good news. 

Suppose I tell you I have [the miracle drug from "Limitless"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(film)), and it also increases your athletic performance, and _also_ reduces your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's, anxiety, and depression.

Wouldn't you do a _lot_ to get that drug? Turns out that it exists, it's free, and it can be found in your bedroom. 

You can basically become superhuman by getting sufficient rest.

Fundamentals: Understanding Your Body
=====================================
To fix your sleep problems, you'll first need to understand some things about your body.

### Two Nervous Systems
You have two opposing nervous systems:

1. **Sympathetic Nervous System:** This is your "fight or flight" nervous system, responsible for wakefulness, focus, and the stress response. It releases adrenaline during dangerous or high-energy activities such as fighting or sports, and also cortisol during longer periods of stress.
2. **Parasympathetic Nervous System:** This is your "rest and digest" nervous system, responsible for relaxation, metabolism, and energy conservation. When engaged, it turns off the stress response and brings us back to a calm place so digestion can occur.

### The Sympathetic Is Stronger
The sympathetic nervous system is faster and stronger than parasympathetic nervous system. You can shoot to 100% stress level in seconds, but it will take hours to come back down.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective: if you're getting chased by a tiger, running away is far more important than sleeping or digestion - even if you're very tired.

This means that it's possible to get into chronic stress states where the sympathetic nervous system is dominating. It's like you're "hooked" in a high-stress state, seemingly unable to come down.

### There's Only One Type Of Stress
Your sympathetic nervous system doesn't distinguish between physical vs psychological stressors. All of these are handled the same:

- A tiger chasing you
- A work deadline
- A stressful videogame
- Financial debt
- An aggressive person on the street at night
- Failing an exam
- Your partner arguing with you
- Feeling inadequate comparing oneself to others on social media
- Feeling socially rejected

### The Circadian Rhythm
Your body has a "circadian clock" that's responsible for telling your body when to sleep (when awake) and when to awaken (when sleeping). This clock is adjusted by exposing your eyes to light.

Specifically, 

Why You Can't Sleep
===================
You can't sleep because your sympathetic nervous system is activated, keeping you locked in a 





Fun Sleep Facts
===============
### Glymphatic System
Your brain contract when you sleep, opening up channels between the brain cells which are used for flushing away cellular waste. This is called your **glymphatic system**. When you don't get enough sleep, it's like your brain cells keep producing garbage but the garbage truck never comes. The trash just keeps accumulating.

### Circadian Rhythms In Pure Darkness
TODO cite study where dude stayed down in cave, and the circadian rhythm extended longer to 26h








And here's the real kicker: 



TODO stimulants: caffeine, methamphetamines, modafinil, cocaine

TODO no judgments on your life until the bags/circles under your eyes are gone


Understanding Sleep
===================
To fix your sleep, you need to understand a bit about how your body works.

First:


TODO people who are sleep-deprived _don't know_ - they think they're functioning at 100%


TODO recovering from sleep debt


TODO why is your mind racing?

TODO why aren't you tired?

I used to be like these people. **I believe this is exceedingly dangerous.**

### My Story
It was the end of 2023, and I was 32. I'd been grinding hard on my startup, sleeping an average 6h40m per night for over a year. I was deeply stressed, and I began to experience inexplicable medical symptoms: 

Sentences didn't make sense unless I read them 2-3 times. My speech wasn't completely under my control, with words getting substituted  (e.g. wanting to say "New Year" but "New York" came out instead). My hands were trembling slightly, and "w"s and "m"s were particularly difficult to write. My vision was trembling slightly, as if the world was having a very minor earthquake. My balance was affected, as if I were on a very slightly moving ship. It was difficult to remember things from a few days ago.

I visited several doctors, including two neurologists. I got tested for multiple sclerosis. Everything came back negative. Nobody could explain what was wrong with me beyond "stress".

I took a month off work as a last resort. Finally... the symptoms started to ease.

It's 2025 as I write this, and I'm mostly back to normal. My hands, memory, and reading comprehension returned. However, I'm not completely fixed. My balance and vision are still slightly wobbly, and my speech still feels awkward at times.

### Aftermath
As I told my burnout story to others in the months that followed, people began to tell me theirs. Crazy stuff: one friend with partial facial paralysis, another with autoimmune-like attacks in her digestive system, another with anxiety attacks.

In all stories, the person's sleep is shit.

I'm not a sleep researcher, but it seems staggeringly clear that sleep is our body's maintenance. If we skip it, our bodies fall apart in basically every way possible:

- [Lack of sleep is increasingly being linked to Alheimzer's and dementia](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/lack-sleep-may-be-linked-risk-factor-alzheimers-disease)
- [Lack of sleep is strongly linked to depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16259539/)
- [Lack of sleep is linked to anxiety as well as depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814343/)
- [Lack of sleep harms athletic performance, reducing performance, reducing muscle recovery, and increasing injury risk](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9960533/#S13)
- [Lack of sleep is linked to diabetes & obesity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18929315/)
- [Lack of sleep makes you feel worse, and reduces your ability to emotionally regulate](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193556/)
- [Lack of sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10565718/)
- [Lack of sleep damages your ability to form memories, including your immune system's "memory" of pathogens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3768102/)
- [Lack of sleep reduces testosterone in males](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijsem/international-journal-of-sports-and-exercise-medicine-ijsem-6-169.php)

As if that's not enough, consider the secondary effects of sleep deprivation you've experienced in your own life:

- Unhealthy sugary, fatty food are more appealing than healthy foods
- Working out is harder, and you're more likely to skip it
- You're more likely to react angrily to irritations, leading to outbursts you have to mend later
- You're not efficient in your work
- You're more likely to keep drinking
- **You're more likely to stay up late doing passive consumption activities like Netflix or social media, thereby making you more tired**

It's not at all surprising that I, and the people I talked to, started to fall apart. **Sleep deprivation is poison!**

Here's the craziest part though:
