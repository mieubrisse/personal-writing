title: "Analyzing Ben Franklin"
subtitle: "Why was Ben Franklin so successful?"
---

I just finished reading Ben Franklin's autobiography. It's unfinished; only his life until 1756 is detailed.

But even with all the "winning a war and starting a country" bits left out, his life was already extremely successful.

I've limited myself to 7 things to ensure I'm 

1. He was a ravenous reader. 
    - Multiple times he uses "intelligent" where I would have used "well-read", suggesting Franklin thought they were synonymous.
    - He valued books highly as ways to upgrade his intelligence
    - Even from a young age, he was always trying to get more books
    - He started the Philadelpha public library as a way to upgrade the colonists
1. He maintained a reputation of honor and good judgement
    - TODO his father known for his good judgement
    - Later, Ben became known for his good judgement
    - This brought powerful people into his life, and they often brought good deals for him because they knew he'd fulfill his side
1. He owned a printing press and could write well.
    - He basically owned a news network
    - Because he could write well, he could both form a persuasive message and could distribute it for very low cost (relative to what other people had to pay)
    - This allowed him to shape public opinion by writing in anonymously before he proposed his policy ideas
1. He was constantly seeking to better himself & the world
    - With physical things
        - Public libraries (rather than individual books)
        - The Franklin stove
        - Lightning rod
        - The four-paned streetlights
        - Bifocals
    - With the social institutions:
        - Firefighting company in Philadelphia
        - His ideas for keeping the streets clean in London
        - The colonial militia during the French and Indian war
    - With himself:
        - The 13 virtues, and tracking his "errors" with a virtue
        - He worked hard
1. He was comfortable delegating to other people. This gave him time to do other things.
    - E.g. David Hall, his printing business partner
    - E.g. his wife, managing his printing business for him
    - E.g. University of Pennsylvania: founded it, but let others run it
    - His wife seems like she ran his printing business for much of his middle and later years, freeing up his time 
    - He calls out in the book that he thinks it's more effective convince others it was their idea and let them try to run it
1. He was easygoing and diplomatic, allowing him 
    - Many, many times he talks about someone and says, "and this person was a great friend to me for the rest of his life"
        - Shows that he got along with many people for life
    - Multiple times in the autobiography he talks about times where he got stiffed, and while he's irritated about it but he doesn't seem to retaliate
        - He doesn't come across as vengeful
    - He intentionally worked on humility, and would let other people take the credit
        - He found this a more effective way to get his ideas spread than him trying to take credit
1. He worked hard.
    - 
1. He rested.
    - 


TODO not a saint - he had his vices. 
- Definitely pretty proud of what he's done, and a bit sullen when his thing isn't taken up.
- Known womanizer
- Sort of neglected his wife, especially in later years
