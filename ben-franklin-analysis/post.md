title: "Building Ben Franklin"
subtitle: "Ben Franklin was enormously successful; this post analyzes why"
---

I just finished reading [Ben Franklin's autobiography](TODO).

It's unfinished - none of the Revolutionary War is included. But even with all the "winning a war and starting a country" bits left out, he was already extremely successful.

Here's my analysis of what made him successful, and how we can incorporate those lessons into our own lives.

He was a ravenous reader
------------------------
Even as a boy, Franklin was always trying to get his hands on more books to read:

> From a Child I was fond of Reading, and all the little Money that came into my Hands was ever laid out in Books... This Bookish Inclination at length determined my Father to make me a Printer, though he had already one Son (James) of that Profession. But, as my Intimacy with my Brother increased, I was frequently in the Printing-House, and became more intelligent.

He says, "I was frequently in the Printing-House, and became more intelligent" suggesting that he thinks being well-read is synonymous with intelligence. 

As an adult [he organized book-trading schemes with his friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junto_(club)), and [founded the first public library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Company_of_Philadelphia).

All this reading meant Franklin was downloading the [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) that would later enable him to be the multidisciplinary thinker he was.

Hearing about Franklin's experience gave me a new appreciation for books. Books in the 1700s had to be written by hand, pressed by hand, and distributed by hand. One book cost several days' wages. 

Today, for $20 we can instantly download the life philosophies of the most successful people in the world. 

Are you taking sufficient advantage of it?

He built a reputation of honor and good judgement
------------------------------------------------------
Franklin's autobiography starts by saying his father was a man "known for his judgement", and [neighbors would seek out Franklin's father when in need of advice](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page04.htm#:~:text=his%20great%20excellence,conduct%20of%20life).

Franklin continued this trend, famously developing his ["13 Virtues"](http://www.benjamin-franklin-history.org/personal-virtues/). In his middle years, the governor of Pennsylvania - his greatest political rival at the time - [even sought Franklin's counsel in private](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page74.htm#:~:text=Notwithstanding%20the%20continual,take%20my%20advice.).

These people often brought business opportunities. They knew Franklin was well-connected and trustworthy, so they'd ask him to do stuff for them in exchange for a cut of the profits.

In this way, **Franklin's honor became an asset**.

As [I've written before, "honor" has a stuffy, antiquated flavor today](https://substack.com/home/post/p-155020167). 

Modern wisdom preaches you've got to look out for yourself, and do what you need to get ahead. Just look at the participants in most Mr. Beast videos.

Yet, the internet amplifies the consequences of our honor or dishonor by spreading them to far more people.

So honorable people today get a double boost: they're rarer and therefore more valuable, and their positive reputation spreads farther.

Here's Naval Ravikant's take:

> Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Your reputation will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not keeping the compound interest in reputation going. 

Are you building an honor asset, or [are you stacking up negative karma](https://substack.com/home/post/p-157909325)?

He could write well and owned a printing press
----------------------------------------------
Newspapers were the cable news networks of the 1700s, on steroids. 

They had wide reach, earned money through advertising, and carried political agendas by virtue of what they included. Because they were expensive (you needed a printing press), there wasn't much competition.

Ben Franklin owned a printing press and could write well. He used this to heavy advantage.

He'd first publish his own writing anonymously. Then he'd let the article soak in, and monitor public reaction. 

Some time later he'd propose the policy change he wanted. The policy frequently passed without complaint.

In doing so, Franklin was utilizing one of Naval Ravikant's four types of leverage, "media" (the other three being "people", "money", and "technology").

Often when we desire change we walk up to the person responsible and say, "We should do X". Often we get pushback.

Instead, learn from Ben Franklin. With social media, everyone has a printing press and audience in their pocket. First try subtly influencing the responsible people to lay the groundwork for the direction you want to go.

Then, when the time is right, propose the actual change you want. It will seem like a natural evolution, rather than an abrupt direction shift.

He was comfortable delegating to others
---------------------------------------
Franklin was definitely not a micromanager. By middle age, Franklin had left the operation of his printing business to a business partner and his wife. 

This pattern of delegating away the operation of things he started continued throughout his life. 

He started the University of Pennsylvania, but left the day-to-day operations to others. 

He created the first Philadelphia firefighting department, but wasn't involved in its operation. 

He proposed a colonial militia during the French and Indian War, but declined a high-ranking position so that someone more qualified could do it.

Franklin recognized the value of "people", another of Naval's four types of leverage.

He built the skill of identifying and trusting good people, which freed up his time for long trips to Europe, writing, and science experiments.

If you struggle with delegating, consider that it's not just about trust.

The skill of delegating has two components:

1. **Trusting:** Working on yourself to be comfortable with others doing things differently than you
2. **Identifying:** sourcing candidates and filtering out those who are a bad fit

I used to think that I was a control freak. I did need to do some work on the first half: being comfortable with others doing things differently. But I also learned that I wasn't sourcing and filtering for the right people. 

I didn't feel comfortable letting go of control because the people I was hiring just weren't good enough.

When I improved my filtering, suddenly delegating became easy. I'd let the person run with it, and they'd do the job _better_ than me. And look at all the free time!

When you get both halves of delegation working, delegation seems like the obvious choice. 

Are you crunched for time? Do you struggle to delegate? If so, do you need to improve one or both of the halves?

He constantly worked to improve himself and the world
-----------------------------------------------------
Ben Franklin wasn't satisfied with stuff that sucked. 

Colonial fireplaces wasted hot air and consumed more wood, so he invented [the Franklin stove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_stove).

The globular streetlamps from England had poor ventilation and would shatter, so [he invented a four-paned streetlamp](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page60.htm#:~:text=The%20honor%20of,very%20poorly%20illuminated.).

Switching near-seeing and far-seeing glasses sucked, so he invented bifocals.

Lightning kept destroying the mostly-wooden colonial structures, so he invented the lightning rod.

And Ben Franklin himself was full of human vice, so he invented [the 13 Virtues and a system to track his progress towards embodying all of them](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page38.htm).

You can channel Franklin's same energy simply by improving things that suck. 

Is the furniture layout in your house bothersome? Reorganize it to something more efficient.

Don't like how your files are organized on your computer? Design a better way.

This doctrine of constant improvement both feels good and gives you back time and energy.

He cultivated likeability
-------------------------
Throughout the autobiography, Franklin often says, "and he was a great friend to me for the rest of his life".

This jumped out to me, as [I'm currently seeking freedom from my own emotional volatility](https://substack.com/home/post/p-155537355). Someone who can maintain many relationships over a lifetime is someone [who fits well with many different types of people](https://altered.substack.com/p/charisma).

Indeed, in the research I did for this post, Franklin is routinely described as very likeable by his peers. 

[From John Adams, who was a rival](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-5574#:~:text=Franklin%20had%20a%20great%20genius%E2%80%94original%2C,the%20French%20call%20na%C3%AFvet%C3%A9%2C%20which):

> He had wit at will. He had humor that when he pleased was delicate and delightful. He had a satire that was good natured or caustic ... at his pleasure. He had talents for irony, allegory and fable, that he could adapt with great skill, to the promotion of moral and political truth. He was master of that infantine simplicity, which the French call naïveté, which never fails to charm, in Phadrus and La Fontaine, from the cradle to the grave.

In modern terms, Franklin was likely high on [the "Agreeableness" dimension of the Big Five personality inventory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness#Big_Five). 

But modern wisdom preaches that you've got to be tough and no-nonsense!

Yet according to ["The New Science of Narcissism" ](https://www.amazon.com/New-Science-Narcissism-Understanding-Psychological/dp/1683644026), the lack of Agreeableness is one of the defining traits of the "dark triad" trait of narcissism. People low in Agreeableness struggle to keep relationships, while [people high in Agreeableness get better outcomes in life](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10888683211073007).

We can learn from Franklin's example by increasing our own Agreeableness.

Fortunately, [Franklin was initially known for being proud and argumentative](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm#:~:text=There%20was%20another,bred%20at%20Edinburgh.). He worked to increase his own Agreeableness, so we get to see how he did it.

### Humility
Over the course of his life, Franklin discovered that a posture of humility was more effective for him.

In his experiments with the Socratic Method, [he found it more advantageous to express himself with uncertainty rather than absolutism](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page07.htm#:~:text=I%20continued%20this,of%20your%20error.). He [later added humility to his list of Virtues precisely to avoid his tendency for pride](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page42.htm#:~:text=My%20list%20of,in%20the%20right.).

Later, [he found that people more readily adopted his ideas when he didn't attach his own name to the project](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page36.htm#:~:text=The%20objections%20and,their%20right%20owner.).

Are you cultivating humility? Not because you "should", but because it will be more effective to you?

### Non-Retaliation
I noticed that Franklin seemed not to retaliate against people who'd wronged him.

In one case, [a governor sent him to London on a promise and completely reneged](https://www.ushistory.org/Franklin/autobiography/page21.htm). Franklin was clearly irritated, but decided to focus his energy on getting a job in London rather than vengeance.

In another, [Franklin had fronted a significant sum of cash to a British general who had arrived without resources to defend the colonies](https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page67.htm). The general was killed in battle, and the treasury in London later refused to reimburse Franklin. Franklin was indignant, but never retaliated.

He even [turned an enemy into a friend by asking to borrow a book from him, subverting his enemy's defenses](https://ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page48.htm#:~:text=I%20therefore%20did,continued%20inimical%20proceedings.). This tactic now has its own Wikipedia page: ["the Franklin effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect).

[I've written before about how anger is a prison you make for yourself](https://substack.com/home/post/p-155024549), and Ben Franklin knew this.

When someone wronged him, he didn't dwell on it. Instead, he focused on moving his life forward. The universe often seemed to bring his antagonizer to justice, and Franklin didn't waste precious time on resentment.

As the quote (possibly Buddhist?) goes,

> Holding on to anger is like drinking poison hoping the other person dies

He worked hard, but he also rested
----------------------------------
Throughout the autobiography I kept thinking, "How does he do so much?"

The modern answer would be, "Because he works nonstop!" But the daily schedule included in the autobiography is impressive for how uncrowded it is:

![TODO DAILY SCHEDULE](TODO)

Franklin slept a good 7 hours, with only TODO hours of work and ample leisure time. 

Modern thinking coming from factory work in the Industrial Revolution has trained us to believe that more hours = more productivity.

But modern knowledge work is not factory work. There comes a point where additional hours = negative productivity. 

Remember what happens when you're sleep-deprived:

1. You make errors you have to clean up later
1. You produce work that seems good at the time, but needs to be thrown away in the morning
1. Your emotional volatility results in outbursts that you have to mend later
1. You focus on urgent, obvious problems rather than taking a step back to solve the most important ones
1. You focus on obvious solutions, missing the non-obvious ones that are better

And as I detailed in [my sleep guide](TODO), when we're chronically sleep deprived we can't actually tell how badly our minds are working. With too much chronic sleep deprivation, our brains "max out" on feeling tired even as our mental performance continues to get worse.

Conclusion
----------
Ben Franklin's autobiography is a goldmine of useful lessons on how to be more effective in life. Throughout it,  TODO TODO
