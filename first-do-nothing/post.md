Anybody who knows me knows one of my favorite mantras: first, do nothing.

The other day a friend was stressing about a girl he liked. She'd given a noncommittal response to his last text message, and many thoughts were going through his head. Did she like him still? Should he send a followup? Should he distance himself from her?

My advice: first, do nothing.

Don't send any messages. Don't draw any conclusions. Don't take any actions with her.

Instead, I suggested he...

- Lie down on his bed
- Meditate
- Write in his journal
- Go for a walk
- Go to the gym

When we feel stressed - angry, afraid, alone, etc. - we feel we _must_ take action Right Now.

Unfortunately, stress straps reality-distortion goggles to our faces. We forget long-term goals in favor of short-term thinking.

How many times have you said something in the heat of the moment, then regretted it as soon as you said it?

How often have you issued an ultimatum over something that _felt_ so crucially important, only to feel ashamed the next day when you realized it didn't matter?

So when you're stressed, first do nothing.

When we take action from a stressed, reactive place,

This is because our stress response evolved in an ancient world where stressors required immediate action. A tiger chasing us, or being expelled from the tribe, meant certain death unless we reacted drastically.

But we don't live in that world anymore. Most things things we fear are no longer dangers.

As I've wr

Stress tricks us into thinking that we _have_ to act right now. This is because our body's can't differentiate between "tiger chasing me in the jungle" and "

Acting from a place of stressed-out urgency _feels_ necessary in the moment... but how many times have you regretted your hasty action right after you took it?

Maybe regretted the message you sent, or the decision you took

If you were negotiating for your life, which environment would you prefer? A pressure-filled, urgent one? Or a calm one, with plenty of time to think?

Obviously the latter. So why do we make

When we're stressed we feel like we _need_ to react.
