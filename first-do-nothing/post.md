_This post is part of a series on negative leverage. To read the first part, [go here][negative-leverage]._

I have a favorite mantra: first, do nothing.

The other day a friend was stressing about a girl he liked. She'd given a noncommittal response to his last text message, and many thoughts were swirling around his head. Did she still like him? Should he send a followup? Should he distance himself from her?

My advice: first, do nothing.

Don't send any messages. Don't draw any conclusions. Don't take any actions with her.

Instead, I suggested he...

- Lie down on his bed
- Meditate
- Write in his journal
- Go for a walk
- Go to the gym

### Stress & Negative Leverage
My "first, do nothing" advice often sounds bad the first time someone hears it. 

They feel I'm not respecting the gravity of the situation. They forget that stress straps reality-distortion goggles to our minds.

When we feel stressed - angry, afraid, alone, etc. - we feel we _must_ take action Right Now. We forget long-term goals and favor short-term thinking. We tunnel vision on what's in front of us.

This urgency was useful in the simple ancient world. 

Back then, stressors like "getting chased by a tiger", "getting expelled from the tribe", and "getting rejected by a romantic prospect" carried real risk of failing to pass on your genes. Sudden drastic action favored survival, else we wouldn't have these instincts.

But urgent response to stress is frequently harmful in the complex modern world. 

Today, most tigers are in zoos, a new tribe is available in the next town over, and the internet delivers thousands of romantic options to your living room. Most perceived threats are not dangerous at all.

Further, [the modern world is full of leverage](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/leveraged-judgment). A hasty decision frequently misses non-obvious solutions that save dozens of hours of work.

How many times have you...

- Said something in the heat of the moment, then wished you could take it back?
- Been confident you knew what was happening (e.g. confident about a person's motivations for doing something), only to find out later that you got it wrong?
- Burned time and energy fighting for something that _felt_ crucially important, then felt sheepish the next day when you realized it didn't matter?

These are examples of [negative leverage][negative-leverage]: small choices that waste lots of your time. If you'd only slowed down and made a different choice, you could have saved hundreds of hours.

[Astronaut Chris Hadfield tells us about a saying at NASA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo62S0ulqhA&ab_channel=TED):

> There's no problem so bad that you can't make it worse

Stress and urgency pressure us to react, but careful - we can _always_ worsen the situation.

"First, do nothing" guards yourself from causing further damage.

By slowing down, you skip negative leverage become faster in the long run.

### Deeply Feeling The Truth
You already know that stress causes bad decisionmaking.

Think about which situation you'd prefer for an important negotiation:

- **Tense:** A pressure-filled, urgent environment
- **Calm:** A relaxed environment with plenty of time to think

Obviously the calm one. You know it gets better outcomes.

But _even knowing this_, I bet you still struggle to slow down when the pressure's on. Our evolved instincts are **strong**. 

Simply knowing that we should slow down isn't enough. Instead you need to deeply feel that slowing down is the right choice.

My business coach, [Ravi Raman](https://raviraman.com/), gave me this metaphor:

> Let's say your daily drive to the office takes 10 minutes.
> If I tell you about a new route that's 2 minutes faster, will you take it?
> Probably not right away... your new route is ingrained in your head, and you only logically know the new one is faster.
> But one day you take it, and feel the speed.
> Now you're never going back to your old route: you've *felt* the difference.

### Identifying When To Slow Down
To apply "first, do nothing" in your life, you must recognize when it's needed.

Here are some of the warning signs I use as warnings that my fight-or-flight nervous system is activated and I need to first do nothing:

- I'm feeling irritated, frustrated, defensive, or resentful
- I'm feeling abandoned or isolated
- I'm feeling pressured
- I'm feeling jealous

Alcoholics Anonymous has the ["HALT"](https://www.ascendantny.com/halt-acronym/) acronym: hungry, angry, lonely, or tired. I know if I'm feeling any of these, my decisionmaking is impaired.

However, my decisionmaking is _also_ compromised when I'm feeling exuberantly positive. 

Have you ever rushed along on a tide of enthusiasm (and maybe some caffeine)? Remember how the situation didn't seem so exciting when the endorphins wore off and you soberly looked at the facts? It's that.

These are some positive states that are also warning signs I need to first do nothing:

- Feeling giddy
- Being so excited I can't sit still
- Feeling an excited rush to do something _right now_

But you already know this.


The point of "first, do nothing" is to create the calm environment for yourself.




My [last post talked about negative leverage][negative-leverage]: little choices that create big problems for yourself in the future.

This saying from NASA focuses specifically on negative leverage in stressful situations. [When you're in a hole, stop digging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_holes).





When something's going wrong, [don't do things that create negative leverage for yourself][negative-leverage]!

This is the same thing as the famous saying, "when you're in a hole, first



So when you're stressed, first do nothing.

How often have you said something from a reactive, stressed place and regretted it the minute you said it? How often has that

As I've wr

Stress tricks us into thinking that we _have_ to act right now. This is because our body's can't differentiate between "tiger chasing me in the jungle" and "

Acting from a place of stressed-out urgency _feels_ necessary in the moment... but how many times have you regretted your hasty action right after you took it?

Maybe regretted the message you sent, or the decision you took

If you were negotiating for your life, which environment would you prefer? A pressure-filled, urgent one? Or a calm one, with plenty of time to think?

Obviously the latter. So why do we make
