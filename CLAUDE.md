The AI Work Factory
-------------------

The author's central thesis — and the lens through which new content should be understood — is the **AI work factory**: the user defines the work, and the factory turns that work into completed results. The goal is removing all non-unique work so the human can focus exclusively on what only they can contribute.

This idea develops across three posts, in order:

1. **[The Goal Is Unique Work](./the-goal-is-unique-work/)** — The foundational argument. Technology embodies efficiency (less input, more output). We should stop spending time on things society already knows how to do and focus on expressing the unique essence of ourselves. The aspiration: "a fluid stream of idea into constructed output."

2. **[Be Rembrandt](./be-rembrandt/)** — Extends the idea using Rembrandt's studio as metaphor. Rembrandt delegated fundamentals to apprentices so he could devote his hours to the details only he could provide. The metaskills of the 21st century are **delegation** and **description** — if you can form what you want into words others can consume, your thoughts get summoned into reality while you sleep.

3. **[Building The Factory](./building-the-factory/)** — The practical implementation. Documents the author's personal automation factory built on n8n + Railway: email triage, data pipelines, book note categorization, and more. Demonstrates the philosophy in action — automating non-unique work so the author can focus on what matters.

When working in this repo, understand that this thematic throughline — unique work, delegation to machines, and building systems that turn ideas into output — is the author's primary intellectual focus.
