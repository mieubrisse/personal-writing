tmux: The Sixth Gear
===============
SUBTITLE TEXT

![](./images/image.png)


write a post about tmux being the sixth gear. Here are the things that I am discovering as I just tried tmux today:
- I can program my terminal windows, so I don't have to just use iTerm's clumsy tab switching. I can instead program the various ones, and I can always start the exact same terminal windows.
- This means that I can start my assistant agents in various panes that I use for controlling my computer, and then I did an fcf (fuzzy switching) between the various panes.
- Then I had them highlight whenever there is a bell going on.
- The copy mode works way better than iTerm's copy mode, and it is customizable, unlike iTerm's copy mode.
- When I close iTerm, it does not shut everything.
- Plus, I can now script the upgrading of certain tabs, like, for example, upgrading all of my Claude Code windows.

add extra stuff, like how I've been programming for 15 years now, and it feels like I've just discovered a new Super Saiyan level or a 6th gear. Plus, it's crazy that tmux can be used to connect to remote servers! Then I can version control my tmux file just like everything else.
