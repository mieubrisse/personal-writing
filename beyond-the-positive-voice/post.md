Positive voice is extremely important

### On Choices
- Choices and opportunities as Equally Good, rather than different
    - I'd implicitly assumed that there is an objective, hidden Good choice and and a Bad choice
        - I had to think a lot, and research, and hypothesize, and worry about the future
        - And that if I thought enough, I would avoid the Bad choice and I would select the Good Choice
        - If I got the Good choice, everything would be perfect and I wouldn't hit any pain
        - This is "Too Perfect" exactly!!!
    - Probably comes from an optimizer nature
    - My previous worldview didn't allow for equally good but different choices
    - Now, I try to regard choices as equally good but different
        - E.g. the Subway story, about the asshole guy
        - BOTH choices will have joy and heartache because that's life
    - I'd been thinking about marriage/family/kids this way too
        - If I get married to the Right Girl and have 3-4 kids then my life will be good and only joy and no heartache
            - There is no "Right Girl", but even if I found her and had my 3-4 kids then I'd have heartache too!!!!!
        - If I am single for the rest of my life then it will be only heartache and no joy
            - Being single the rest of my life would have joys in it too!!! It wouldn't just be heartache

- I've been using therapy as a magic bullet - once I'm Fixed then I'll get The Perfect Girl and then I'll have The Perfect Family
    - Enough-ness _requires_ finding happiness along the way

- Secure attachment, defining feature is they're unreactive to negative stimuli; they _expect_ the world and their partner to treat them well and be responsive to their needs
    - This seems to come from a positive regard for themselves and how they deserve to be treated
- Why I think enough-ness isn't a magic bullet (though I don't know): it requires you to _stop_ doing things (stop striving, stop trying to achieve), rather than do more
- The importance of Sitting With The Emotion as a way to process things
    - I used to think that I needed to have epiphanies, but I can only think of one real epiphany: the ex-boyfriends-as-my-allies epiphany
    - I think more commonly, growth happens by being Aware and choosing the better choice
- Catching catastrophization: strategy for booting up the positive voice
    - When thinking about outcomes, I immediately assum
    - E.g. I won't ever date a girl as good as she is again
    - "If the future is unknown, and unknown-ness is 50% one way and 50% the other, isn't it actually better 50% of the time?"
- Critical Voice -> I have a lack -> I need to achieve -> I have a plan for what I need to do -> I need to get from point A to point B -> I'm on rails -> deviation from the rails is bad & anxiety-inducing -> no room for spontaneity, or letting life surprise you -> no actual adventure
    - Maybe this is tied to the Good Choices/Bad Choices false dichotomy?
    - Ties into the Avoidant attachment style: idea of the Perfect Person, and any deviation is bad
    - Destination Thinking is intrinsic to the trap
    - Doesn't allow for choices 
    - The only adventures are Approved Adventures that follow The Plan
    - V's struggles with which job to take: could it be that?
