I write like I'm painting.

Splash stuff down. Refine. Splash more (maybe at a later point in time). Refine.

The goal is minimal friction between mind and materialization.

Be Brandon Sanderson, not George R. R. Martin.

Painting, not surgery.

To support this I've developed a writing system.

Steal what you like from it.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  I heavily use the terminal and automation. If you're not comfortable with this... you need to be, because it gives you insane efficiency. üòú

The repo
--------
To write like you're painting, you need to [feel confident you can roll back errors](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/the-value-of-ai#:~:text=all%20the%20time.-,Guardrails%20like%3A,-%22Oops%2C%20not%20what).

You also need to own your painting.

This is a solved problem, so the source of truth for my writing is a [Git](https://github.blog/developer-skills/programming-languages-and-frameworks/what-is-git-our-beginners-guide-to-version-control/) repository (not Substack).

Each post that's not yet published is on its own branch.

The repo's layout is as follows:

```
TEMPLATE/
   post.md
   images/
some-post/
   post.md
   images/
      image.png
      some-image.png
      some-other-image.png
some-other-post/
   post.md
   images/
      image.png
...
```

Each post's text is in `post.md`.

`TEMPLATE/post.md` contains scaffolding for each post (detailed below). Remember, [the goal is unique work][goal-is-unique-work].

`images` contains the images I reference in the post (including the cover image).

I heavily leverage automation to work with the repo:

- Summon up a new post from anywhere on my machine with `pn the post name` (`pn` = `post new`) from my [writing tools][writing-tools] to:
    1. `cd`s into my writing repo
    1. Checks out a new branch
    1. Copies `TEMPLATE` into a directory named after the new post
    1. Commits everything
    1. Opens `post.md` in Vim
- Dip into an existing post from anywhere on my machine with `pf query terms` (`pf` = `post find`) from my [writing tools][writing-tools] to:
    1. Fuzzy-search for post directories containing `query terms` across all branches, with the option to interactively refine the query (remember, we want to paint)
    1. Upon selection, switch to the branch containing the post and open `post.md` in Vim
- Switch between branches using fuzzy queries with my [special `git checkout` alias](https://github.com/mieubrisse/dotfiles/blob/8039ceeeb868e74a3a52e7c4898a858edb9e23a2/bash/bash_aliases#L322-L371)
- Switch between directories and posts using my [fuzzy open-anything ‚åò-K for the terminal](https://github.com/mieubrisse/cmdk)
- Commit without writing unnecessary characters using [my `gg` and `gcmm` Git commit conveniences](https://github.com/mieubrisse/dotfiles/blob/8039ceeeb868e74a3a52e7c4898a858edb9e23a2/bash/bash_aliases#L403-L404)

The goal is painting, and these tools let me drop into splashing ideas within one second.

Much of this automation leans on [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). It's so absurdly good.

TODO SUBSCRIBE BUTTON

The writing
-----------
All my posts are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It's just better than anything else.

<!-- TODO link to inputs not outputs when it's ready -->

As of 2025-07-09, the `TEMPLATE/post.md` scaffolding looks like this:

    ---
    title: "TODO"
    subtitle: "TODO"
    ---

    <!------------------------- REFERENCE LINKS BLOCK ----------------------------------->
    [TODO]: some-link
    <!----------------------- END REFERENCE LINKS BLOCK --------------------------------->

Notes:

- There's always a cover image at the top (`image.png`), that I generate with ChatGPT
- The "REFERENCE LINKS" block is only for links that I repeat multiple times in the spirit of [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself); often it's unused
- The "IG POST DESCRIPTION" and "IG STORY TEXT" are more reminders to think about social; I often find that it's better to write the actual copy in Instagram because I better feel how it fits
- h1 and h2 headers use the `=======` and `------` style rather than `#` and `##` because they're easier to visually distinguish

I edit in Vim using [this config](https://github.com/mieubrisse/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc). It, too, is just better than anything else.

Some fancy features of my Vim:

- `\h=` will h1-ize lines, so calling it on:
  ```
  My h1 header
  ```
  turns it into
  ```
  My h1 header
  ============
  ```
  [.vimrc code here](https://github.com/mieubrisse/dotfiles/blob/8039ceeeb868e74a3a52e7c4898a858edb9e23a2/vim/vimrc#L402)
- `\h-` will h1-ize lines, so calling it on:
  ```
  My h2 header
  ```
  turns it into
  ```
  My h2 header

  [.vimrc code here](https://github.com/mieubrisse/dotfiles/blob/8039ceeeb868e74a3a52e7c4898a858edb9e23a2/vim/vimrc#L403)
- `\c` will open the Markdown in Chrome (more on that later)

I try to let thoughts flow, resisting the urge to edit (though I often can't help myself).

When adding links, I don't fill in the URL at first. While writing I often do this:

```
Hey, I want to link [to something](note to myself about where this URL goes to)
```

I then fill in the URL later, before I post (more on this down below). I'm building [link-summoner][link-summoner] to automate this process.

Image links get added using Markdown's image link syntax, with an optional caption added below:

```
![](./images/some-image.png)

_Optional caption_
```

Numbered lists always start with `1.`, like so:

```markdown
1. First item
1. Second item
1. Third item
```

Trying to keep the order is a waste of time because the Markdown renderer will fix it for me and I frequently adjust ordering.

I occasionally add notes for just myself. For example, to link to a post that I'm planning but doesn't exist yet.

This happens using Markdown comments:

```
<!-- TODO link to <post I'm planning> when it's published -->
```

You guys don't see it, but it's there as a reminder for myself. I always include the word "TODO" because it's a consistent search term I can use to find all my TODOs at a later point in time.

I often need to flip to Chrome to do research for a post.

I have [Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) rebind the `Fn` key on my Mac to the "hyper" modifier (`cmd+ctrl+option`), and then use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) to bind `hyper-q` to open Chrome (`q` because `hyper-c` is my calendar).

I also have Raycast bind `hyper-t` to my terminal ([iTerm](https://iterm2.com/)), so I can get to it with one keypress.

Publishing
----------
### Cover image
When I'm ready to publish, I generate an image with ChatGPT (bound to `hyper-g`).

ChatGPT's folders let you add custom instructions applying to just the chats in the folder, so I have a folder called "üñºÔ∏è Blog Post Image Generation" with these custom instructions:

```
You are creative image-generating bot responsible for generating striking, unique cover images for blog posts the user writes. The goal of the images is to entice readers to click on the post.

Favor realism or surrealism, and avoid simplistic, cartoon-like, or diagram-like images. Lean away from any sort of "duality" themes, as these are overused.

Your images should always be in square or landscape aspect ratios.

Unless the user explicitly requests text in the generated image, it is crucially important that your generated image MUST NOT include any text whatsover.

The user may or may not include the text of the blog post the user wrote. If so, the text of the blog post will be provided after a header entitled "TEXT".

If the user does provide blog post text, you should use it for inspiration but need not feel compelled to slavishly include everything from the post. In the blog post text you may see lines like "TODO SUBSCRIBE BUTTON"; these can be ignored. You may also see lines that start with HTML comments like <!-- --> . These can also be ignored.

Again, your primary function is to generate striking, unique, realistic or surrealist images.
```

The "üñºÔ∏è" in the folder name is to make it visually obvious when I'm looking for it in the mess of my ChatGPT conversations in the sidebar.

<!-- TODO link to inputs, not outputs -->

I'll then "paint" on the image ChatGPT generates, iterating successively. Some tips for your own iteration:

- I often start with the blog post text itself, and see what ChatGPT spits out. Sometimes this leads to cool stuff, but other times it generates bland unappealing nonsense. If it's spitting out crap, I switch to giving it an idea of what I want.
- I find that once it generates an image, it gets "locked" into a line of thinking based on that image. If you don't like the original image, I often find it useful to have it re-roll the image using the "Try again" feature (üîÅ icon) rather than trying to refine the image.
- To save an output I sorta like, I'll save it into the post's `images` directory.
- ChatGPT's really bad at taking an input image and making an output that looks like it. If I want to explore parallel lines of thinking for an image, I'll have it turn the image into a text with this prompt:
  ```
  Describe this image in excruciating detail, producing a text that's detailed enough so that I can paste it into a new conversation and have you generate the same image.
  ```
  (There's probably a product somewhere in here about Git branch-like workflows for image generation.)

Once I have an image I'm happy with, it gets dropped into `images` as `image.png` (which is the default filename for images downloaded from ChatGPT, which is why that's the filename versus something like `cover.png`).

### Previewing
I then preview what the file will look like in the browser using [this Chrome extension that will render Markdown into HTML](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk).

To open the file, I use either:

- `\c` inside Vim ([.vimrc code](https://github.com/mieubrisse/dotfiles/blob/8039ceeeb868e74a3a52e7c4898a858edb9e23a2/vim/vimrc#L392-L395))
- `chrome post.md` from the terminal ([.bashrc code](https://github.com/mieubrisse/dotfiles/blob/8039ceeeb868e74a3a52e7c4898a858edb9e23a2/bash/bash_aliases#L90-L112))

I'll then edit and review until I'm happy with it.

### Final checks
I then open the writing repo in Chrome using [Github CLI's](https://cli.github.com/) `gh browse`, and open a pull request.

Every pull request runs automation to verify that all the links in the writing repo are still valid. This is the safety net to remind me about all the URLs that I didn't fill in while writing.

I use CircleCI because that's what I used historically, but I'd like to switch to Github actions.

The CircleCI config:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  validate:
    docker:
      # We have to install version 3.12.1 because 3.12.2 has a regression where dead links don't return a failing exit code
      # See: https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check/issues/457 and https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check/pull/452
      - image: ghcr.io/tcort/markdown-link-check:3.12.1
    resource_class: small
    steps:
      - checkout

      # Gotchas I discovered when writing this:
      # - Without the '--no-pager' flag, Git will print "WARNING: Terminal is not fully functional" and not display any output
      # - Circle has no way of getting the PR base branch, so we have to hardcode the base branch :( See: https://ideas.circleci.com/cloud-feature-requests/p/provide-env-variable-for-branch-name-targeted-by-pull-request
      # - The --exit-code flag to git-diff returns 0 on no changes, 1 on changes
      # - We have to use 'origin/master' rather than 'master' because Circle does a shallow checkout, and 'master' gets set to something weird and wrong that makes the check buggy
      - run: "! git --no-pager diff --exit-code origin/master...HEAD CHANGELOG.md"

      - run:
          name: Check links in Markdown docs
          command: |
            markdown-link-check --config markdown-link-check-config.json --retry -v $(find . -iname '*.md' | grep -v 'TEMPLATE/')

workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - validate:
          filters:
            branches:
              ignore: main
```

When the CI checks pass, I merge into `main` and the post branch gets deleted thanks to the "Auto-delete branches" setting on the Github repo.

### Adding on Substack
I then create a new post in Substack, copy the post from the HTML-rendered Markdown in Chrome, and paste it into Substack.

This mostly works, though there are a few things that don't:

- Images don't load in Substack, so I need to delete them and re-add using Substack's native image widget
- I have to manually switch the `_Optional image caption_` below images to be an actual image caption on the Substack image widget, else the text won't be centered
- I have to manually switch the `TODO SUBSCRIBE BUTTON` to the actual Substack subscribe widget

In the process, I often find typos and adjustments to make.

Ideally, I'd make these in Markdown and re-render the Markdown into Substack. But because of the little things that don't work, this would mean I need to re-make the manual changes.

Instead, I make my adjustments in parallel to the Substack draft and the Markdown. The adjustments in Markdown gets committed directly to `main`.

### Publishing & amplifying
I have a checklist template (in Markdown of course) in a separate `checklists-and-templates` repo to run the publishing process. As of 2025-07-09 it looks like this:

```
BEFORE POSTING
--------------
1. Decide on tagline that will go in post caption text
1. Ensure I have hashtags in the post caption text
1. Ensure I have "Share" or "Subscribe" CTAs in the post!
1. Create a PR and merge into main

AFTER POSTING
-------------
### Prep
1. Download the shareable image that Substack generates for the post
1. Post the shareable link that Substack generates to my self Whatsapp group (for using in Stories)
1. Send raw cover image to myself on Whatsapp for stories

### On Mac
1. Restack my own post
1. Post a feed post to kevinjtoday, ensuring to cut off the `mieubrisse.substack`
1. Post the link to Twitter
1. Post the link to Linkedin
1. Post in the Discord
1. Send to all the friends that I've recorded as interested

### On Phone
1. Share story with raw cover from Whatsapp WITH LINK to kevinjtoday
```

I copy this template for each post I'm publishing, then run it.

The result is a published post, with posts on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kevinjtoday/), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevintoday/), and [Twitter](https://x.com/kevinjtoday).

Further work
------------
This system has me feel like I'm flying, and I can get short posts out 1-2 hours while medium ones like this one take 2-3. But I can always fly faster:

- I'd like to finish [link-summoner][link-summoner], then upgrade it so it can automatically fill in links I commonly use (e.g. my socials, my repos).
- I don't want to do manual fixing in Substack; I want to just modify the Markdown and regenerate the Substack post. This would have the extra benefit of allowing me to fail CI if there's "TODO" in the Markdown, ensuring I don't miss anything. 
    - There's probably a product in here for technical writers. <!-- TODO link to inputs not outputs -->
- Right now I manually open the pull request to merge the branch into `main`. I'd like automation that opens the PR for me, and notifies me when the checks pass or fail.
- CI checks run even on branches that don't yet have a PR open for them. It's not a big deal, but it pollutes my email if the CI fails so I want to modify the CI config to only run CI checks on branches being merged into `main`.
- I have to manually edit the publishing checklist Markdown file in Vim. I want a little terminal app that lets me scroll up and down lines and tick them off with a keystroke. I've taken a stab at this previously with [montu](https://github.com/mieubrisse/montu), but it needs a rewrite.
- I'd like to train an AI on my writing to lay down the first rough brush strokes for me to refine.

Conclusion
----------
So now you have my system, and can start flying too. I'd love to hear your feedback:

What's useful for you?

How are you taking it and making it your own?
