1. **What you focus on defines your reality.** If you focus on positive things and what you already have, you will feel positive. If you focus on negative thinks and what you lack, you will feel negative.
1. **Happiness isn't something you finally achieve.** It's a (sometimes difficult) choice made in each minute of each day to let go of the negative things you're focusing on.
1. **Anger is a poison you take hoping the other person will die.** When you're angry, you are choosing to enslave yourself to the object of your anger: spending the precious minutes of your life in a bad mental state, needing the object of your anger to be brought low.
1. **Big things are routinely born from tiny choices.** You fought with your partner because you were tired because you drank too much the night before because you agreed to "Just one drink" even though you knew you rarely stick to just one drink. Etc.
1. **Whenever we're upset, afraid, or stressed, 99% of the time the first thing is to do nothing.** There's no situation that can't be made worse. Even though most things _feel_ like they need an answer Right Now, most don't. Don't send any messages, don't draw any boundaries, don't make any decisions. Just go workout, write in your journal, look out a window, or meditate. Make a decision later when you're calm - days later if need be.
1. **Addiction always has a psychological component.**
1. **To sleep well, you need ~1 hour of wind-down before bed.** Trying to crash straight from TV, videogames, sports, etc. means that either I take the 1h lying awake in bed, or I pass out from exhaustion but wake up unrested.
1. **Your mind is a liar.** When we're scared of something, it sure _feels_ certain and inevitable. But what about all those times we were scared and the thing didn't happen?
1. **Karma is real.** Not for any grand cosmic reason, but because if you're nice to the people & things around you then they'll be nice back. If you're nasty to the people & things around you, they'll be nasty back. TODO link to Mr Magic Thesis
1. **You are the CEO of the Business of You.** As the CEO, you have a responsibility to the Business of You to maximize your potential and accomplish your goals. When you do what others want even though you don't believe in it, you're failing as CEO. When you tolerate people who drain your energy, you're failing as CEO.
1. **You do not control your emotions, but you do control how you react to them.** You have no say in whether you feel angry, envious, resentful, etc. You do control the actions you take while experiencing those emotions.
1 . **It's okay not to be okay.** When you're feeling bad, don't pile on and make yourself feel worse. Instead, accept that you are imperfect and have down days. Then do something nice to yourself that doesn't have addictive potential: listen to some calming music, go for a walk, do some stretching, write in your journal.
1. **There is always a 'GOOD'.** Positive can always be found in every single situation. Even if it seems like there's nothing, you always learned and learning is always positive. Got fired? Good - an opportunity for different responsibilities. Partner broke up with you? Good - you're no longer with someone who isn't committed to being with you. Lost your money in the stock market? Good - you've just learned valuable financial lessons about how to build longterm wealth.
1. **Block feeds in apps.** Feeds are weapons designed by armies of psychologists to keep you inside their app. They're anti-intentionality: designed to make you as much a dopamine-driven animal as possible.
1. **When you're bored, read. When you're anxious, write.**
1. **Music is a drug.** If you listen to angry music, you will get activated. If you listen to calm music, you will calm down. Choose
