Today's world is one of [leveraged judgment](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/leveraged-judgment).

But if good judgment is everything, how do we get there?

View your honor as an asset
---------------------------
As I've written before, [the modern world underestimates honor](https://mieubrisse.substack.com/p/leveraged-judgment).


Practice emotional control
--------------------------

Take care of ourselves
----------------------

Learn from the mistakes of others
---------------------------------
